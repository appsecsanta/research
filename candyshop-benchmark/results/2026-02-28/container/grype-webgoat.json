If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-21350","epss":0.08244,"percentile":0.9206,"date":"2026-02-27"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-21350","cwe":"CWE-434","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2021-21350","cwe":"CWE-502","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"com.thoughtworks.xstream:xstream","version":"1.4.5"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-43gc-mjxg-gvrq","versionConstraint":"<1.4.16 (unknown)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.4.16"}}],"artifact":{"id":"51099d75144b0685","name":"xstream","version":"1.4.5","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/home/webgoat/webgoat.jar","layerID":"sha256:8dd01ff157deb045769a969cd4f982917d46665363e21a917f67f0dfc164ce75","accessPath":"/home/webgoat/webgoat.jar:BOOT-INF/lib/xstream-1.4.5.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":["http://xstream.codehaus.org/license.html"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:com.thoughtworks.xstream:xstream:1.4.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:thoughtworks:xstream:1.4.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:xstream:xstream:1.4.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/com.thoughtworks.xstream/xstream@1.4.5","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/home/webgoat/webgoat.jar:BOOT-INF/lib/xstream-1.4.5.jar","pomArtifactID":"xstream","pomGroupID":"com.thoughtworks.xstream","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"61c0a127b237182fdf2ccc9cc2efbb5779a64a3b"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-j563-grx4-pjpv","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j563-grx4-pjpv","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-j563-grx4-pjpv","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41966","https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2022-41966.html"],"description":"XStream can cause Denial of Service via stack overflow","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":4.3},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41966","epss":0.04274,"percentile":0.8862,"date":"2026-02-27"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41966","cwe":"CWE-120","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-41966","cwe":"CWE-121","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-41966","cwe":"CWE-502","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-41966","cwe":"CWE-674","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.4.20"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.4.20","date":"2026-02-12","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":3.3550899999999997},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-41966","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41966","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-j563-grx4-pjpv","https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2022-41966.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230216-0005/"],"description":"XStream serializes Java objects to XML and back again. Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":4.3},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41966","epss":0.04274,"percentile":0.8862,"date":"2026-02-27"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41966","cwe":"CWE-120","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-41966","cwe":"CWE-121","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-41966","cwe":"CWE-502","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-41966","cwe":"CWE-674","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"com.thoughtworks.xstream:xstream","version":"1.4.5"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-j563-grx4-pjpv","versionConstraint":"<1.4.20

summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted\nexplicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads\nor writes.\n\nImpact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or\neven a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols\ninvolving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only \"named\ncurves\" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they\nspecify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent\nproblematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable\napplication is low.\n\nIn particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,\nso problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509\ncertificates.

Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable\napplication is low.\n\nIn particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,\nso problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509\ncertificates.

In XZ Utils 5.3.3alpha to 5.8.0, the multithreaded .xz decoder in liblzma has a bug where invalid input can at least result in a crash. The effects include heap use after free and writing to an address based on the null pointer plus an offset. Applications and libraries that use the lzma_stream_decoder_mt function are affected. The bug has been fixed in XZ Utils 5.8.1, and the fix has been committed to the v5.4, v5.6, v5.8, and master branches in the xz Git repository. No new release packages will be made from the old stable branches, but a standalone patch is available that applies to all affected releases.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":8.7},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-31115","epss":0.00256,"percentile":0.48727,"date":"2026-02-27"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-31115","cwe":"CWE-366","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2025-31115","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2025-31115","cwe":"CWE-476","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2025-31115","cwe":"CWE-826","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"24.04"},"package":{"name":"xz-utils","version":"5.6.1+really5.4.5-1build0.1"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:24.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-31115","versionConstraint":"< 5.6.1+really5.4.5-1ubuntu0.2 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"5.6.1+really5.4.5-1ubuntu0.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"495ba4761bbac1df","name":"liblzma5","version":"5.6.1+really5.4.5-1build0.1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:baf95fd13a1d4a1d112f931943d1beb53ea3010daf1912aaf2a94e082255b586","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/liblzma5/copyright","layerID":"sha256:375990b2a90a8d8f332d9b9422d948f7068a3313bf5a1c9fbb91ff2d29046130","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/liblzma5/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/liblzma5:arm64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:375990b2a90a8d8f332d9b9422d948f7068a3313bf5a1c9fbb91ff2d29046130","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/liblzma5:arm64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Autoconf","GPL-2","GPL-2+","GPL-3","LGPL-2","LGPL-2.1","LGPL-2.1+","PD","PD-debian","config-h","noderivs","permissive-fsf","permissive-nowarranty","probably-PD"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:liblzma5:liblzma5:5.6.1\\+really5.4.5-1build0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/liblzma5@5.6.1%2Breally5.4.5-1build0.1?arch=arm64&distro=ubuntu-24.04&upstream=xz-utils","upstreams":[{"name":"xz-utils"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-h3gc-qfqq-6h8f","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h3gc-qfqq-6h8f","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"High","urls":["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48988","https://lists.apache.org/thread/nzkqsok8t42qofgqfmck536mtyzygp18","https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/2b0ab14fb55d4edc896e5f1817f2ab76f714ae5e","https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/cdde8e655bc1c5c60a07efd216251d77c52fd7f6","https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/ee8042ffce4cb9324dfd79efda5984f37bbb6910","https://tomcat.apache.org/security-10.html","https://tomcat.apache.org/security-11.html","https://tomcat.apache.org/security-9.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/06/16/1","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/07/msg00009.html"],"description":"Apache Tomcat - DoS in multipart upload","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.7},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-48988","epss":0.00146,"percentile":0.35016,"date":"2026-02-27"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-48988","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"security@apache.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["10.1.42"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"10.1.42","date":"2026-02-12","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.11388},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-48988","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48988","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://lists.apache.org/thread/nzkqsok8t42qofgqfmck536mtyzygp18","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/06/16/1","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/07/msg00009.html"],"description":"Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.7, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.41, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.105.\nThe following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are \nknown to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100.

Spring Framework, versions 6.0.x as of 6.0.5, versions 6.1.x and 6.2.x, an application is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack when it sets a “Content-Disposition” header with a non-ASCII charset, where the filename attribute is derived from user-supplied input.\n\nSpecifically, an application is vulnerable when all the following are true:\n\n  *  The header is prepared with org.springframework.http.ContentDisposition.\n  *  The filename is set via ContentDisposition.Builder#filename(String, Charset).\n  *  The value for the filename is derived from user-supplied input.\n  *  The application does not sanitize the user-supplied input.\n  *  The downloaded content of the response is injected with malicious commands by the attacker (see RFD paper reference for details).\n\n\nAn application is not vulnerable if any of the following is true:\n\n  *  The application does not set a “Content-Disposition” response header.\n  *  The header is not prepared with org.springframework.http.ContentDisposition.\n  *  The filename is set via one of:  *  ContentDisposition.Builder#filename(String), or\n  *  ContentDisposition.Builder#filename(String, ASCII)\n\n\n\n  *  The filename is not derived from user-supplied input.\n  *  The filename is derived from user-supplied input but sanitized by the application.\n  *  The attacker cannot inject malicious content in the downloaded content of the response.\n\n\nAffected Spring Products and VersionsSpring Framework:\n\n  *  6.2.0 - 6.2.7\n  *  6.1.0 - 6.1.20\n  *  6.0.5 - 6.0.28\n  *  Older, unsupported versions are not affected\n\n\nMitigationUsers of affected versions should upgrade to the corresponding fixed version.\n\nAffected version(s)Fix versionAvailability6.2.x6.2.8OSS6.1.x6.1.21OSS6.0.x6.0.29

For that reason\nthe severity of this vulnerability is Low.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.1,"exploitabilityScore":0.7,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-13176","epss":0.00123,"percentile":0.3155,"date":"2026-02-27"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-13176","cwe":"CWE-385","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"24.04"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"3.0.13-0ubuntu3.4"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:24.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-13176","versionConstraint":"< 3.0.13-0ubuntu3.5 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.0.13-0ubuntu3.5"}}],"artifact":{"id":"e26d71aeae56fb44","name":"openssl","version":"3.0.13-0ubuntu3.4","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:baf95fd13a1d4a1d112f931943d1beb53ea3010daf1912aaf2a94e082255b586","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:baf95fd13a1d4a1d112f931943d1beb53ea3010daf1912aaf2a94e082255b586","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:baf95fd13a1d4a1d112f931943d1beb53ea3010daf1912aaf2a94e082255b586","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list","layerID":"sha256:baf95fd13a1d4a1d112f931943d1beb53ea3010daf1912aaf2a94e082255b586","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst","layerID":"sha256:baf95fd13a1d4a1d112f931943d1beb53ea3010daf1912aaf2a94e082255b586","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst"}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:3.0.13-0ubuntu3.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/openssl@3.0.13-0ubuntu3.4?arch=arm64&distro=ubuntu-24.04","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-r936-gwx5-v52f","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r936-gwx5-v52f","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-41242","http://spring.io/security/cve-2025-41242"],"description":"Spring Framework MVC Applications Path Traversal Vulnerability","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-41242","epss":0.00067,"percentile":0.20748,"date":"2026-02-27"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-41242","cwe":"CWE-22","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.2.10"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"6.2.10","date":"2026-02-12","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.036515},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-41242","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-41242","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://spring.io/security/cve-2025-41242"],"description":"Spring Framework MVC applications can be vulnerable to a “Path Traversal Vulnerability” when deployed on a non-compliant Servlet container.\n\nAn application can be vulnerable when all the following are true:\n\n  *  the application is deployed as a WAR or with an embedded Servlet container\n  *  the Servlet container  does not reject suspicious sequences https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/6.1/jakarta-servlet-spec-6.1.html#uri-path-canonicalization \n  *  the application  serves static resources https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-config/static-resources.html#page-title  with Spring resource handling\n\n\nWe have verified that applications deployed on Apache Tomcat or Eclipse Jetty are not vulnerable, as long as default security features are not disabled in the configuration.

This issue has been patched in version 1.6.51.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":4.3},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-64720","epss":0.00071,"percentile":0.21652,"date":"2026-02-27"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-64720","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"24.04"},"package":{"name":"libpng1.6","version":"1.6.43-5build1"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:24.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-64720","versionConstraint":"< 1.6.43-5ubuntu0.1 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.6.43-5ubuntu0.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"c2ed18e1fc93ec8c","name":"libpng16-16t64","version":"1.6.43-5build1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:baf95fd13a1d4a1d112f931943d1beb53ea3010daf1912aaf2a94e082255b586","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libpng16-16t64/copyright","layerID":"sha256:baf95fd13a1d4a1d112f931943d1beb53ea3010daf1912aaf2a94e082255b586","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libpng16-16t64/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libpng16-16t64:arm64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:baf95fd13a1d4a1d112f931943d1beb53ea3010daf1912aaf2a94e082255b586","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libpng16-16t64:arm64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Apache-2.0","BSD-3-clause","BSD-like-with-advertising-clause","GPL-2","GPL-2+","expat","libpng"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libpng16-16t64:libpng16-16t64:1.6.43-5build1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libpng16-16t64:libpng16_16t64:1.6.43-5build1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libpng16_16t64:libpng16-16t64:1.6.43-5build1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libpng16_16t64:libpng16_16t64:1.6.43-5build1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libpng16:libpng16-16t64:1.6.43-5build1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libpng16:libpng16_16t64:1.6.43-5build1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libpng16-16t64@1.6.43-5build1?arch=arm64&distro=ubuntu-24.04&upstream=libpng1.6","upstreams":[{"name":"libpng1.6"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-45582","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-45582","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:24.04","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-45582","epss":0.00068,"percentile":0.21017,"date":"2026-02-27"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-45582","cwe":"CWE-24","source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.034},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-45582","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-45582","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/i900008/vulndb/blob/main/Gnu_tar_vuln.md","https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-tar/2025-08/msg00012.html","https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/","https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Integrity.html","https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Security-rules-of-thumb.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/11/01/6"],"description":"GNU Tar through 1.35 allows file overwrite via directory traversal in crafted TAR archives, with a certain two-step process. First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of \"Member name contains '..'\" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain \"x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh\" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which \"tar xf\" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages). NOTE: the official GNU Tar manual has an otherwise-empty directory for each \"tar xf\" in its Security Rules of Thumb; however, third-party advice leads users to run \"tar xf\" more than once into the same directory.","cvss":[{"source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-45582","epss":0.00068,"percentile":0.21017,"date":"2026-02-27"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-45582","cwe":"CWE-24","source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"24.04"},"package":{"name":"tar","version":"1.35+dfsg-3build1"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:24.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-45582","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"241fbe7c8c74d6f6","name":"tar","version":"1.35+dfsg-3build1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:baf95fd13a1d4a1d112f931943d1beb53ea3010daf1912aaf2a94e082255b586","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/tar/copyright","layerID":"sha256:375990b2a90a8d8f332d9b9422d948f7068a3313bf5a1c9fbb91ff2d29046130","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/tar/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/tar.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:375990b2a90a8d8f332d9b9422d948f7068a3313bf5a1c9fbb91ff2d29046130","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/tar.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/tar.list","layerID":"sha256:375990b2a90a8d8f332d9b9422d948f7068a3313bf5a1c9fbb91ff2d29046130","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/tar.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/tar.postinst","layerID":"sha256:375990b2a90a8d8f332d9b9422d948f7068a3313bf5a1c9fbb91ff2d29046130","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/tar.postinst"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/tar.prerm","layerID":"sha256:375990b2a90a8d8f332d9b9422d948f7068a3313bf5a1c9fbb91ff2d29046130","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/tar.prerm"}],"language":"","licenses":["GPL-2","GPL-2+","GPL-3","GPL-3+","LGPL-2.1","LGPL-2.1+","LGPL-3","LGPL-3+"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar:tar:1.35\\+dfsg-3build1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/tar@1.35%2Bdfsg-3build1?arch=arm64&distro=ubuntu-24.04","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-3198","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-3198","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:24.04","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-3198","epss":0.00068,"percentile":0.20948,"date":"2026-02-27"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-3198","cwe":"CWE-401","source":"cna@vuldb.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2025-3198","cwe":"CWE-404","source":"cna@vuldb.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2025-3198","cwe":"CWE-401","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.42-4ubuntu2.6"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"2.42-4ubuntu2.6","date":"2026-02-10","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.034},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-3198","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-3198","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32716","https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32716#c0","https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;h=ba6ad3a18cb26b79e0e3b84c39f707535bbc344d","https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.303151","https://vuldb.com/?id.303151","https://vuldb.com/?submit.545773","https://www.gnu.org/"],"description":"A vulnerability has been found in GNU Binutils 2.43/2.44 and classified as problematic.

If the type-id OID is invalid or malformed, GnuTLS will call asn1_delete_structure() on an ASN.1 node it does not own, leading to a double-free condition when the parent function or caller later attempts to free the same structure.\n\nThis vulnerability can be triggered using only public GnuTLS APIs and may result in denial of service or memory corruption, depending on allocator behavior.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":4.3},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4.3},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-32988","epss":0.00036,"percentile":0.10636,"date":"2026-02-27"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-32988","cwe":"CWE-415","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"24.04"},"package":{"name":"gnutls28","version":"3.8.3-1.1ubuntu3.2"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:24.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-32988","versionConstraint":"< 3.8.3-1.1ubuntu3.4 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.8.3-1.1ubuntu3.4"}}],"artifact":{"id":"1e328bdb0e07c887","name":"libgnutls30t64","version":"3.8.3-1.1ubuntu3.2","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:baf95fd13a1d4a1d112f931943d1beb53ea3010daf1912aaf2a94e082255b586","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libgnutls30t64/copyright","layerID":"sha256:375990b2a90a8d8f332d9b9422d948f7068a3313bf5a1c9fbb91ff2d29046130","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libgnutls30t64/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libgnutls30t64:arm64.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:375990b2a90a8d8f332d9b9422d948f7068a3313bf5a1c9fbb91ff2d29046130","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libgnutls30t64:arm64.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libgnutls30t64:arm64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:375990b2a90a8d8f332d9b9422d948f7068a3313bf5a1c9fbb91ff2d29046130","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libgnutls30t64:arm64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Apache-2.0","BSD-3-Clause","CC0","Expat","GFDL-1.3","GPL","GPL-3","GPLv3+","LGPL","LGPL-3","LGPLv2.1+","LGPLv3+_or_GPLv2+","The"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libgnutls30t64:libgnutls30t64:3.8.3-1.1ubuntu3.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libgnutls30t64@3.8.3-1.1ubuntu3.2?arch=arm64&distro=ubuntu-24.04&upstream=gnutls28","upstreams":[{"name":"gnutls28"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-69421","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-69421","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:24.04","severity":"Low","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-69421","epss":0.00059,"percentile":0.18446,"date":"2026-02-27"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-69421","cwe":"CWE-476","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.0.13-0ubuntu3.7"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"3.0.13-0ubuntu3.7","date":"2026-02-10","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0177},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-69421","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-69421","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/3524a29271f8191b8fd8a5257eb05173982a097b","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/36ecb4960872a4ce04bf6f1e1f4e78d75ec0c0c7","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4bbc8d41a72c842ce4077a8a3eccd1109aaf74bd","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/643986985cd1c21221f941129d76fe0c2785aeb3","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/a2dbc539f0f9cc63832709fa5aa33ad9495eb19c","https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20260127.txt"],"description":"Issue summary: Processing a malformed PKCS#12 file can trigger a NULL pointer\ndereference in the PKCS12_item_decrypt_d2i_ex() function.\n\nImpact summary: A NULL pointer dereference can trigger a crash which leads to\nDenial of Service for an application processing PKCS#12 files.\n\nThe PKCS12_item_decrypt_d2i_ex() function does not check whether the oct\nparameter is NULL before dereferencing it.

They can read sensitive content loaded into memory by the original binary, affecting data confidentiality.","cvss":[{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.7,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-4598","epss":0.00035,"percentile":0.1024,"date":"2026-02-27"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-4598","cwe":"CWE-364","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"24.04"},"package":{"name":"systemd","version":"255.4-1ubuntu8.4"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:24.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-4598","versionConstraint":"< 255.4-1ubuntu8.8 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"255.4-1ubuntu8.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"fb69c90c59a61b7d","name":"libudev1","version":"255.4-1ubuntu8.4","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:baf95fd13a1d4a1d112f931943d1beb53ea3010daf1912aaf2a94e082255b586","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libudev1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:375990b2a90a8d8f332d9b9422d948f7068a3313bf5a1c9fbb91ff2d29046130","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libudev1/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libudev1:arm64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:375990b2a90a8d8f332d9b9422d948f7068a3313bf5a1c9fbb91ff2d29046130","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libudev1:arm64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["CC0-1.0","Expat","GPL-2","GPL-2+","LGPL-2.1","LGPL-2.1+","public-domain"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libudev1:libudev1:255.4-1ubuntu8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libudev1@255.4-1ubuntu8.4?arch=arm64&distro=ubuntu-24.04&upstream=systemd","upstreams":[{"name":"systemd"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-11412","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-11412","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:24.04","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-11412","epss":0.00035,"percentile":0.09883,"date":"2026-02-27"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-11412","cwe":"CWE-119","source":"cna@vuldb.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2025-11412","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"cna@vuldb.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2025-11412","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.42-4ubuntu2.8"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"2.42-4ubuntu2.8","date":"2026-02-10","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.017499999999999998},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-11412","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-11412","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=16378","https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=33452","https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=33452#c8","https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;h=047435dd988a3975d40c6626a8f739a0b2e154bc","https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.327348","https://vuldb.com/?id.327348","https://www.gnu.org/"],"description":"A vulnerability has been found in GNU Binutils 2.45.

Older EOL versions are not affected.\nTomcat did not validate that the host name provided via the SNI \nextension was the same as the host name provided in the HTTP host header \nfield. If Tomcat was configured with more than one virtual host and the \nTLS configuration for one of those hosts did not require client \ncertificate authentication but another one did, it was possible for a \nclient to bypass the client certificate authentication by sending \ndifferent host names in the SNI extension and the HTTP host header field.\n\n\n\nThe vulnerability only applies if client certificate authentication is \nonly enforced at the Connector. It does not apply if client certificate \nauthentication is enforced at the web application.\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.15 or later, 10.1.50 or later or 9.0.113 or later, which fix the issue.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-66614","epss":0.0002,"percentile":0.05122,"date":"2026-02-27"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-66614","cwe":"CWE-20","source":"security@apache.org","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core","version":"10.1.36"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-fpj8-gq4v-p354","versionConstraint":">=10.1.0-M1,<10.1.49 (unknown)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"10.1.49"}}],"artifact":{"id":"3d75dbdc92e90dda","name":"tomcat-embed-core","version":"10.1.36","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/home/webgoat/webgoat.jar","layerID":"sha256:8dd01ff157deb045769a969cd4f982917d46665363e21a917f67f0dfc164ce75","accessPath":"/home/webgoat/webgoat.jar:BOOT-INF/lib/tomcat-embed-core-10.1.36.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":["https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:apache:tomcat-embed-core:10.1.36:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:tomcat_embed_core:10.1.36:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:tomcat:10.1.36:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:embed:10.1.36:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.tomcat.embed/tomcat-embed-core@10.1.36","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/home/webgoat/webgoat.jar:BOOT-INF/lib/tomcat-embed-core-10.1.36.jar","pomArtifactID":"tomcat-embed-core","pomGroupID":"org.apache.tomcat.embed","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"3ccaa558e32e317e35d6674d65d7d9aa182e082f"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-8225","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-8225","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:24.04","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-8225","epss":0.00022,"percentile":0.05656,"date":"2026-02-27"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-8225","cwe":"CWE-401","source":"cna@vuldb.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2025-8225","cwe":"CWE-404","source":"cna@vuldb.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2025-8225","cwe":"CWE-401","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.42-4ubuntu2.6"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"2.42-4ubuntu2.6","date":"2026-02-10","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.011000000000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-8225","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8225","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Low","urls":["https://gitlab.com/gnutools/binutils-gdb/-/commit/e51fdff7d2e538c0e5accdd65649ac68e6e0ddd4","https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.317813","https://vuldb.com/?id.317813","https://vuldb.com/?submit.621883","https://www.gnu.org/"],"description":"A vulnerability was found in GNU Binutils 2.44 and classified as problematic.

or accessing files from unexpected locations, which a local attacker may be able to exploit.\n\nThe bug was introduced in commit 11a11ecf4bea72b17d250cfb43c897be1341861e and released in Perl version

For that reason the issue was assessed as\nLow severity.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue,\nas the BIO implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.\n\nOpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are vulnerable to this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":4.7,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-68160","epss":0.00014,"percentile":0.02542,"date":"2026-02-27"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-68160","cwe":"CWE-787","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"24.04"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"3.0.13-0ubuntu3.4"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:24.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-68160","versionConstraint":"< 3.0.13-0ubuntu3.7 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.0.13-0ubuntu3.7"}}],"artifact":{"id":"e26d71aeae56fb44","name":"openssl","version":"3.0.13-0ubuntu3.4","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:baf95fd13a1d4a1d112f931943d1beb53ea3010daf1912aaf2a94e082255b586","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:baf95fd13a1d4a1d112f931943d1beb53ea3010daf1912aaf2a94e082255b586","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:baf95fd13a1d4a1d112f931943d1beb53ea3010daf1912aaf2a94e082255b586","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list","layerID":"sha256:baf95fd13a1d4a1d112f931943d1beb53ea3010daf1912aaf2a94e082255b586","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst","layerID":"sha256:baf95fd13a1d4a1d112f931943d1beb53ea3010daf1912aaf2a94e082255b586","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst"}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:3.0.13-0ubuntu3.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/openssl@3.0.13-0ubuntu3.4?arch=arm64&distro=ubuntu-24.04","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2026-0861","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2026-0861","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:24.04","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2026-0861","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00643,"date":"2026-02-27"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2026-0861","cwe":"CWE-190","source":"3ff69d7a-14f2-4f67-a097-88dee7810d18","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.39-0ubuntu8.7"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"2.39-0ubuntu8.7","date":"2026-02-10","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.004},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2026-0861","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-0861","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=33796","https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob_plain;f=advisories/GLIBC-SA-2026-0001","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2026/01/16/5"],"description":"Passing too large an alignment to the memalign suite of functions (memalign, posix_memalign, aligned_alloc) in the GNU C Library version 2.30 to 2.42 may result in an integer overflow, which could consequently result in a heap corruption.\n\nNote that the attacker must have control over both, the size as well as the alignment arguments of the memalign function to be able to exploit this.
