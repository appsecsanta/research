This can create a significant security risk by allowing code injection.\n- **Do not** use `ast.literal_eval()` with unsanitized user input. While `literal_eval` is often considered to be less risky than `eval` because it evaluates strings as Python data structures only (integers, strings, dictionaries,etc), an attacker could exploit this function with deeply nested structures that could cause excessive memory allocation or stack consumption.\n- **Do** use dynamic hardcoded values instead of direct user input to mitigate the risk of code injection. This approach allows for controlled execution of code without exposing your application to injected malicious code. For example, use a dictionary to store functions, and call these based on user input.\n  ```python\n  def total_with_vat(a, b):\n    total = a + b\n    return total + total * 0.15\n\n  def total_without_vat(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\n  get_total = {\n    \"incl_vat\": total_with_vat,\n    \"excl_vat\": total_without_vat\n  }\n\n  if form.cleaned_data[\"include_vat\"]:\n    total_func = get_total[\"incl_vat\"]\n    total = total_func(a, b)\n\n  # ...\n  ```\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP Code injection explained](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Code_Injection)","documentation_url":"https://docs.bearer.com/reference/rules/python_lang_eval_using_user_input","line_number":6,"full_filename":"sources/vulnpy/src/vulnpy/trigger/unsafe_code_exec.py","filename":"src/vulnpy/trigger/unsafe_code_exec.py","source":{"start":6,"end":6,"column":{"start":12,"end":22}},"sink":{"start":6,"end":6,"column":{"start":12,"end":22},"content":""},"parent_line_number":6,"fingerprint":"58f440d99df66313892fbccb07f1017d_0","old_fingerprint":"45bdbd2e6c4f7521a2ccb00b0a92cc01_0","code_extract":"    return eval(code)"},{"cwe_ids":["78"],"id":"python_lang_os_command_injection","title":"Unsanitized user input in OS command","description":"## Description\n\nDirectly incorporating external or user-defined input into an OS command exposes the system to possible command injection attacks.
