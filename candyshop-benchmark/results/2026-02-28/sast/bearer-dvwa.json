This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- **Do not** include user input directly in HTML strings. This practice can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.\n  ```php\n  $html = \"\u003ch1\u003e{$_GET[\"title\"]}\u003c/h1\u003e\"; // unsafe\n  ```\n- **Do** use a templating language like Twig, and keep the template in a separate file. Templating languages automatically handle input sanitization, reducing the risk of XSS.\n- **Do** sanitize user input when HTML strings must be used, to prevent malicious code injection.\n  ```php\n  $html = \"\u003ch1\u003e${htmlspecialchars($_GET[\"title\"])}\u003c/h1\u003e\";\n  ```\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Cheatsheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)","documentation_url":"https://docs.bearer.com/reference/rules/php_lang_raw_html_using_user_input","line_number":11,"full_filename":"sources/dvwa/vulnerabilities/xss_r/source/medium.php","filename":"vulnerabilities/xss_r/source/medium.php","category_groups":["PII","Personal Data"],"source":{"start":11,"end":11,"column":{"start":2,"end":37}},"sink":{"start":11,"end":11,"column":{"start":11,"end":37},"content":""},"parent_line_number":11,"fingerprint":"bf259bdda12d064e4862dac6012c5b0f_0","old_fingerprint":"4a03c995eb504206737a803f381a01a7_9","code_extract":"\t$html .= \"\u003cpre\u003eHello {$name}\u003c/pre\u003e\";"},{"cwe_ids":["79"],"id":"php_lang_raw_output_using_user_input","title":"Unsanitized user input in 'echo' function (XSS)","description":"## Description\n\nIncluding unsanitized user input in responses can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
