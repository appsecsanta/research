This issue arises because some regular expressions can be processed with exponential time complexity. When attackers exploit this, it can significantly drain CPU resources, effectively causing a denial of service. ## Remediations - **Do** validate all dynamic and user-supplied input against a strict safelist of allowed characters before using it in regular expressions. This step helps prevent attackers from injecting malicious patterns. - **Do** restrict the length of input that can be processed. Limiting input size is a straightforward way to mitigate many ReDoS vulnerabilities. - **Do** implement timeouts for regular expression evaluation to avoid excessive resource consumption. This can be achieved using JavaScript environments or libraries that allow setting execution time limits. - **Do** simplify complex regular expressions to reduce the risk of catastrophic backtracking. Breaking down expressions into simpler parts makes them safer and more manageable. - **Do not** directly concatenate user input into regular expressions. This practice can introduce unsafe patterns and lead to vulnerabilities. ```javascript var dynamicRegex = new RegExp('^' + userInput); // unsafe ``` ## References - [OWASP Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)",pending,low,no,1
