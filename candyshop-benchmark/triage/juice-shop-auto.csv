Impact summary: A stack buffer overflow may lead to a crash, causing Denial of Service, or potentially remote code execution. When parsing CMS (Auth)EnvelopedData structures that use AEAD ciphers such as AES-GCM, the IV (Initialization Vector) encoded in the ASN.1 parameters is copied into a fixed-size stack buffer without verifying that its length fits the destination. An attacker can supply a crafted CMS message with an oversized IV, causing a stack-based out-of-bounds write before any authentication or tag verification occurs. Applications and services that parse untrusted CMS or PKCS#7 content using AEAD ciphers (e.g., S/MIME (Auth)EnvelopedData with AES-GCM) are vulnerable. Because the overflow occurs prior to authentication, no valid key material is required to trigger it. While exploitability to remote code execution depends on platform and toolchain mitigations, the stack-based write primitive represents a severe risk. The FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue, as the CMS implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary. OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue. OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected by this issue.",pending,low,no,1

This issue arises because some regular expressions can be processed with exponential time complexity. When attackers exploit this, it can significantly drain CPU resources, effectively causing a denial of service. ## Remediations - **Do** validate all dynamic and user-supplied input against a strict safelist of allowed characters before using it in regular expressions. This step helps prevent attackers from injecting malicious patterns. - **Do** restrict the length of input that can be processed. Limiting input size is a straightforward way to mitigate many ReDoS vulnerabilities. - **Do** implement timeouts for regular expression evaluation to avoid excessive resource consumption. This can be achieved using JavaScript environments or libraries that allow setting execution time limits. - **Do** simplify complex regular expressions to reduce the risk of catastrophic backtracking. Breaking down expressions into simpler parts makes them safer and more manageable. - **Do not** directly concatenate user input into regular expressions. This practice can introduce unsafe patterns and lead to vulnerabilities. ```javascript var dynamicRegex = new RegExp('^' + userInput); // unsafe ``` ## References - [OWASP Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)",pending,low,no,1

This vulnerability occurs when input provided by users is directly used to access the filesystem without proper validation or sanitization. ## Remediations - **Do not** directly use user input to construct file paths. This can lead to unauthorized file access. - **Do** sanitize user input used in file paths. Replace patterns that can navigate out of intended directories, such as `..\..`, to prevent path traversal attacks. ```javascript var folder = target.replace(/^(\.\.(\/|\\|$))+/, ''); ``` - **Do** check for and remove any instances of the NULL byte (""%00"") in user input to guard against poison NULL byte attacks. ```javascript if (target.indexOf('\0') !== -1) { // Handle or reject the input } ``` - **Do** use path concatenation methods provided by your programming environment to securely combine user input with your base directory path. This ensures the final path starts within the intended scope. ```javascript const path = require(""path""); var pathname = path.join(""/public/"", folder); if (pathname.indexOf(""/public/"") !== 0) { // Handle or reject the input } ``` ## References - [OWASP Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal)",TP,medium,yes,1
