In a typical web application, cookies are used to store and transmit session-related data between a client and a server. To enhance security, cookies can be marked with the \"SameSite\" attribute, which restricts their usage based on the origin of the page that set them. This attribute can have three values: \"Strict,\" \"Lax,\" or \"None\". Make sure that the choice of the `None` value is intentional and that you understand the potential security implications. When `SameSite` is set to \"Strict\", no 3rd party cookie will be sent with outgoing requests. While 'Strict' is the most secure option, 'Lax' is a good compromise between security and usability and this default value is secure for most applications.
