In a typical web application, cookies are used to store and transmit session-related data between a client and a server. To enhance security, cookies can be marked with the \"SameSite\" attribute, which restricts their usage based on the origin of the page that set them. This attribute can have three values: \"Strict,\" \"Lax,\" or \"None\". Make sure the `SameSite` attribute of the important cookies (e.g., session cookie) is set to a reasonable value. When `SameSite` is set to \"Strict\", no 3rd party cookie will be sent with outgoing requests, this is the most secure and private setting but harder to deploy with good usability. Setting it to \"Lax\" is the minimum requirement. If this wasn't intentional, it's recommended to set the SameSite flag to the `Strict` or `Lax` value, depending on your needs.",
